  <title>Twitter users and news, Part II</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52% of U.S. adult Twitter users get at least some news on Twitter,
        and the standard error for this estimate was 2.4%. Identify each of the following statements as true or false.
        Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The data provide statistically significant evidence that more than half of U.S. adult Twitter users get some news through Twitter.
              Use a significance level of <m>\alpha = 0.01</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since the standard error is 2.4%, we can conclude that 97.6% of all U.S. adult Twitter users were included in the study.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If we want to reduce the standard error of the estimate,
              we should collect less data.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If we construct a 90% confidence interval for the percentage of U.S. adults Twitter users who get some news through Twitter,
              this confidence interval will be wider than a corresponding 99% confidence interval.

    <title>Chronic illness, Part II</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In 2013, the Pew Research Foundation reported that
        <q>45% of U.S. adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions</q>, and the standard error for this estimate is 1.2%. Identify each of the following statements as true or false.
        Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              We can say with certainty that the confidence interval from <xref ref="chronic_illness_intro"></xref>
              contains the true percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from a chronic illness.

          <li>
            <p>
              If we repeated this study 1,000 times and constructed a 95% confidence interval for each study,
              then approximately 950 of those confidence intervals would contain the true fraction of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The poll provides statistically significant evidence
              (at the <m>\alpha = 0.05</m> level)
              that the percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses is below 50%.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since the standard error is 1.2%, only 1.2% of people in the study communicated uncertainty about their answer.

              False. Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values, and sometimes the truth is missed. A 95% confidence interval <q>misses</q> about 5% of the time.

              True. The 95% confidence interval is given by: <m>(42.6\%, 47.4\%)</m>, and we can see that 50% is outside of this interval. This means that in a hypothesis test, we would reject the null hypothesis that the proportion is 0.

  <title>Relaxing after work</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The General Social Survey asked the question: <q>After an average work day, about how many hours do you have to relax or pursue activities that you enjoy?</q> to a random sample of 1,155 Americans.<fn>National Opinion Research Center, <url href="http://gss.norc.org/get-the-data">General Social Survey, 2018.</url></fn> A 95% confidence interval for the mean number of hours spent relaxing or pursuing activities they enjoy was <m>(1.38, 1.92)</m>.

  <title>Testing for food safety</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A food safety inspector is called upon to investigate a restaurant with a few customer reports of poor sanitation practices. The food safety inspector uses a hypothesis testing framework to evaluate whether regulations are not being met. If he decides the restaurant is in gross violation, its license to serve food will be revoked.

            <p>
              As a diner, would you prefer that the food safety inspector requires strong evidence or very strong evidence of health concerns before revoking a restaurant's license? Explain your reasoning.

          <li>
            <p>
              The food safety inspector concludes that the restaurant does not meet food safety and sanitation regulations and shuts down the restaurant when the restaurant is actually safe.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The food safety inspector concludes that the restaurant meets food safety and sanitation regulations and the restaurant stays open when the restaurant is actually not safe.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A Type 1 Error may be more problematic for the restaurant owner since his restaurant gets shut down even though it meets the food safety and sanitation regulations.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A Type 2 Error may be more problematic for diners since the restaurant deemed safe by the inspector is actually not.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Strong evidence. Diners would rather a restaurant that meet the regulations get shut down than a restaurant that doesn't meet the regulations not get shut down.

  <title>Unemplyment and relationship problems</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A USA Today/Gallup poll asked a group of unemployed and underemployed Americans if they have had major problems in their relationships with their spouse or another close family member as a result of not having a job (if unemployed) or not having a full-time job (if underemployed). 27% of the 1,145 unemployed respondents and 25% of the 675 underemployed respondents said they had major problems in relationships as a result of their employment status.

          <li>
            <p>
              What are the hypotheses for evaluating if the proportions of unemployed and underemployed people who had relationship problems were different?

          <li>
            <p>
              If each gender was equally paid, then we would expect about half of those positions to have men paid more than women and women would be paid more than men in the other half of positions. Write appropriate hypotheses to test this scenario.

          </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            In effect, we're checking whether men are paid more than women (or vice-versa), and we'd expect these outcomes with either chance under the null hypothesis:
            <md>
              <mrow>H_{0}: p=0.5 \amp \amp H_{A} p \ne 0.5</mrow>
            </md>
            We'll use p to represent the fraction of cases where men are paid more than women.

        <li>

            Below is the completion of the hypothesis test.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  There isn't a good way to check independence here since the jobs are not a simple random sample. However, independence doesn't seem unreasonable, since the individuals in each job are different from each other. The success-failure condition is met since we check it using the null proportion: <m>p_{0}n = (1-p_{0})n = 10.5</m> is greater than 10.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  We can compute the sample proportion, SE, and test statistic:
                  <md>
                    <mrow>\hat{p}=19/21 = 0.905</mrow>
                    <mrow>SE=\sqrt{\frac{0.5 \times (1-0.5)}{21}}=0.109</mrow>
                    <mrow>Z=\frac{0.905-0.5}{0.109}=3.72</mrow>
                  </md>
                  The test statistic <m>Z</m> corresponds to an upper tail area of about 0.0001, so the p-value is 2 times this value: 0.0002.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the notion that all these gender pay disparities are due to chance. Because we observe that men are paid more in a higher proportion of cases and we have rejected <m>H_{0}</m>, we can conclude that men are being paid higher amounts in ways not explainable by chance alone.
                </p>
