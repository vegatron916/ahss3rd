      <em>Advanced High School Statistics</em> covers a first course in statistics,
      providing an introduction to applied statistics that is clear,
      concise,
      and accessible.

    We hope readers will take away three ideas from this book in addition to forming a foundation of statistical thinking and methods.

          Statistics is an applied field with a wide range of practical applications.

          You don't have to be a math guru to learn from real, interesting data.

          Data are messy, and statistical tools are imperfect.
          But, when you understand the strengths and weaknesses of these tools,
          you can use them to learn about the real<nbsp/>world.
