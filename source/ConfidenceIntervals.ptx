    <title>Capturing the population parameter</title>
    <p>
      A point estimate provides a single plausible value for a parameter.
      However, a point estimate isn't perfect and will have some
      <em>standard error</em> associated with it.
      When estimating a parameter,
      it is better practice to provide a plausible
      <em>range of values</em>
      instead of supplying just the point estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A plausible range of values for the population parameter is called a
      <term>confidence interval</term>.
      Using only a point estimate is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear,
      and using a confidence interval is like fishing with a net.
      We can throw a spear where we saw a fish,
      but we will probably miss.
      On the other hand, if we toss a net in that area,
      we have a good chance of catching the fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we report a point estimate,
      we probably will not hit the exact population parameter.
      On the other hand,
      if we report a range of plausible values <mdash/> a confidence interval <mdash/> we have a good shot at capturing the parameter.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Constructing a 95% confidence interval</title>
    <p>
      A point estimate is our best guess for the value of the parameter,
      so it makes sense to build the confidence interval around that value.
      The standard error is a measure of the uncertainty associated with the point estimate.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many standard errors should we extend above and below the point estimate if we want to be 95% confident of capturing the true value?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First, we observe that the area under the standard normal curve between -1.96 and 1.96 is 95%. When conditions for a normal model are met,
          the point estimate we observe will be within 1.96 standard deviations of the true value about 95% of the time.
          Thus, if we want to be 95% confident of capturing the true value,
          we should go 1.96 standard errors on either side of the point estimate.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Constructing a 95% confidence interval using a normal model</title>
      <p>
        When the sampling distribution of a point estimate can reasonably be modeled as normal,
        a 95% confidence interval for the unknown parameter can be constructed as:
        <men>
          \text{ point estimate } \ \pm\ 1.96 \times SE\text{ of estimate }
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can be <alert>95% confident</alert>
        that this interval captures the true value.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      In the next chapters we will determine when we can apply a normal model to a point estimate.
      For now, we will assume that a normal model is reasonable.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The point estimate from the smoking example was 15%. The standard error for this point estimate was calculated to be <m>SE = 0.04</m>.
          Assuming that conditions for a normal model are met,
          construct and interpret a 95% confidence interval.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <md>

            <mrow>(0.071\amp 6\text{ , }  0.2284)</mrow>
          </md>
          We are 95% confident that the true percent of smokers in this population is between 7.16% and 22.84%.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Based on the confidence interval above,
          is there evidence that a smaller proportion smoke in this county than in the state as a whole?
          The proportion that smoke in the state is known to be 0.20.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          While the point estimate of 0.15 is lower than 0.20,
          this deviation is likely due to random chance.
          Because the confidence interval <em>includes</em>
          the value 0.20, 0.20 is a reasonable value for the proportion of smokers in the county.
          Therefore, based on this confidence interval,
          we do not have evidence that a smaller proportion smoke in the county than in the state.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      We can be 95% confident that a 95% confidence interval captures the true population parameter.
      However, confidence intervals are imperfect.
      About 1-in-20 (5%) properly constructed 95% confidence intervals will fail to capture the parameter of interest.
      <xref ref="x95PercentConfidenceInterval"></xref>
      shows 25 confidence intervals for a proportion that were constructed from simulations where the true proportion was <m>p = 0.3</m>.
      However, 1 of these 25 confidence intervals happened not to include the true value.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="x95PercentConfidenceInterval">
      <caption>Twenty-five samples of size <m>n=300</m> were simulated when <m>p = 0.30</m>. For each sample, a confidence interval was created to try to capture the true proportion <m>p</m>. However, 1 of these 25 intervals did not capture <m>p = 0.30</m>.</caption>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="x95PercentConfidenceInterval"></xref>,
          one interval does not capture the true proportion, <m>p = 0.3</m>.
          Does this imply that there was a problem with the simulations?
          <fn>No.
          Just as some observations occur more than 1.96 standard deviations from the mean,
          some point estimates will be more than 1.96 standard errors from the parameter.
          A confidence interval only provides a plausible range of values for a parameter.
          While we might say other values are implausible based on the data,
          this does not mean they are impossible.</fn>

    <title>Changing the confidence level</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>confidence level</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we want to construct a confidence interval with a confidence level somewhat greater than 95%: perhaps we would like a confidence level of 99%.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Other things being equal,
          would a 99% confidence interval be wider or narrower than a 95% confidence interval?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Using a previous analogy:
          if we want to be more confident that we will catch a fish,
          we should use a wider net, not a smaller one.
          To be 99% confidence of capturing the true value,
          we must use a wider interval.
          On the other hand, if we want an interval with lower confidence,
          such as 90%, we would use a narrower interval.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      The 95% confidence interval structure provides guidance in how to make intervals with new confidence levels.
      Below is a general 95% confidence interval for a point estimate that comes from a nearly normal distribution:
      <men>
        \text{ point estimate } \ \pm\ 1.96\times SE \text{ of estimate }
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three components to this interval: the point estimate,
      <q>1.96</q>, and the standard error.
      The choice of <m>1.96\times SE</m> was based on capturing 95% of the distribution since the estimate is within 1.96 standard deviations of the true value about 95% of the time.
      The choice of 1.96 corresponds to a 95% confidence level.

      To create a 99% confidence interval,

      <xref ref="leadInForMakingA99PercentCIExercise"></xref>
      highlights that 99% of the time a normal random variable will be within 2.58 standard deviations of its mean.
      Thus, the formula for a 99% confidence interval is

    <p>
      The <em>number</em> of standard errors we go above and below the point estimate is called the
      <term>critical value</term>.
      When the critical value is determined based on a normal model,
      we call the critical value <m>z^{\star}</m>.

    <assemblage>
      <title>Confidence interval for any confidence level</title>
      <p>
        If the point estimate follows a normal model with standard error <m>SE</m>,
        then a confidence interval for the population parameter is
        <md>
          <mrow>\text{ point estimate } \ \pm\ z^{\star} \times SE \text{ of estimate }</mrow>
        </md>
        where <m>z^{\star}</m> depends on the confidence level selected.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      Finding the value of <m>z^{\star}</m> that corresponds to a particular confidence level is most easily accomplished by using a new table,
      called the <m>t</m>-table.
      For now, what is noteworthy about this table is that the bottom row corresponds to confidence levels.
      The numbers inside the table are the critical values,
      but which row should we use?
      Later in this book,
      we will see that a <m>t</m>-curve with infinite degrees of freedom corresponds to the normal curve.
      For this reason, when finding <m>z^{\star}</m>,
      we use the <m>t</m>-table at row <m>\infty</m>.

      The normal approximation is crucial to the precision of these confidence intervals.

    </p>
    <p>
      A careful eye might have observed the somewhat awkward language used to describe confidence intervals.
      Correct interpretation:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We are C% confident that the population parameter is between <fillin/> and <fillin/>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <em>Incorrect</em> language might try to describe the confidence interval as capturing the population parameter with a certain probability.<fn>
      To see that this interpretation is incorrect,
      imagine taking two random samples and constructing two 95% confidence intervals for an unknown proportion.
      If these intervals are disjoint,
      can we say that there is a 95%+95%=190% chance that the first or the second interval captures the true value?
      </fn> Applying the language of probability to a fixed interval or to a fixed parameter is one of the most common errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we saw in <xref ref="x95PercentConfidenceInterval"></xref>,
      the 95% confidence interval <em>method</em>
      has a 95% probability of producing an interval that will capture the population parameter.
      A correct interpretation of the confidence <em>level</em>
      is that such intervals will capture the population parameter that percent of the time
      (assuming conditions are met and the probability model is true).
      However, each individual interval either does or does not capture the population parameter.
      A correct interpretation of an individual confidence interval cannot involve the vocabulary of probability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another especially important consideration of confidence intervals is that they
      <em>only try to capture the population parameter</em>.
      Our intervals say nothing about the confidence of capturing individual observations,
      a proportion of the observations, or point estimates.
      Confidence intervals only attempt to capture population parameters.

          A point estimate is not perfect;
          there is almost always some error in the estimate.
          It is often useful to supply a plausible
          <em>range of values</em> for the parameter,
          which we call a <term>confidence interval</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A confidence interval is centered on the point estimate and extends a certain number of standard errors on either side of the estimate,
          depending upon how <em>confident</em> one wants to be.
          For a fixed sample size,
          to be more confident of capturing the true value requires a wider interval.
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          When the sampling distribution of a point estimate can reasonably be modeled as <em>normal</em>,
          such as with a <term>sample proportion</term>,
          then the following are true:

      <li>
        <p>
          For a C% confidence interval described above,
          we select <m>z^{\star}</m> such that the area between -<m>z^{\star}</m> and
          <m>z^{\star}</m> under the standard normal curve is C%. Use the <m>t</m>-table at row <m>\infty</m> to find the critical value <m>z^{\star}</m>.<fn>

          After interpreting the interval,

          The confidence level tells us the
            <em>capture rate</em> with repeated sampling.
            For example,
            a correct interpretation of a 95% confidence level is that if many samples of the same size were taken from the population,
            about 95% of the resulting confidence intervals would capture the true population parameter
            (assuming the conditions are met and the probability model is true).
            Note that this is a <em>relative frequency interpretation</em>.

            We cannot use the language of probability to interpret an
            <em>individual</em> confidence interval,
            once it has been calculated.
            The confidence level tells us what percent of the intervals will capture the population parameter,
            not the probability that a calculated interval captures the population parameter.
            Each calculated interval either does or does not capture the population parameter.

            The <term>margin of error</term> (<m>ME</m>) <m>=\text{ critical value } \times SE\ \text{ of estimate }</m>,
            and it tells us, with a particular confidence,

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The margin of error depends on the

            the standard error does not.
            Other things being constant,
            a higher confidence level leads to a larger margin of error.

        <li>

            For a fixed confidence level,

            The margin of error formula only applies if a sample is random.

            <em>sampling error</em>;
            it does not account for additional error introduced by response bias and non-response bias.
            Even with a perfectly random sample,
            the actual error in a poll is likely higher than the reported margin of error.<fn><url href="nytimes.com/2016/10/06/upshot/when-you-hear-the-margin-of-error-is-plus-or-minus-3-percent-think-7-instead.html">nytimes.com/2016/10/06/upshot/when-you-hear-the-margin-of-error-is-plus-or-minus-3-percent-think-7-instead.html</url>

        between when they checked in to the ER until they were first seen by a doctor.

    <title>Mental health</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The General Social Survey asked the question: <q>For how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health,
        which includes stress, depression,
        and problems with emotions,
        not good?</q> Based on responses from 1,151 US residents,
        the survey reported a 95% confidence interval of 3.40 to 4.24 days in 2010.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Interpret this interval in context of the data.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              What does
              <q>95% confident</q>
              mean?
              Explain in the context of the application.

          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose the researchers think a 99% confidence level would be more appropriate for this interval.
              Will this new interval be smaller or wider than the 95% confidence interval?

          <li>
            <p>
              If a new survey were to be done with 500 Americans,
              do you think the standard error of the estimate be larger,
              smaller, or about the same.

    <title>Cyberbullying rates</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Teens were surveyed about cyberbullying,
        and 54% to 64% reported experiencing cyberbullying (95% confidence interval).<fn>Pew Research Center, <url href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/09/27/a-majority-of-teens-have-experienced-some-form-of-cyberbullying/">A Majority of Teens Have Experienced Some Form of Cyberbullying</url>. September 27, 2018.</fn> Answer the following questions based on this interval.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              A newspaper claims that a majority of teens have experienced cyberbullying.
              Is this claim supported by the confidence interval?
              Explain your reasoning.

          <li xml:id="cyberbullying_prop_ci_ht_researcher">
            <p>
              A researcher conjectured that 70% of teens have experienced cyberbullying.
              Is this claim supported by the confidence interval?
              Explain your reasoning.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Without actually calculating the interval,
              determine if the claim of the researcher from <xref ref="cyberbullying_prop_ci_ht_researcher" /> would be supported based on a 90% confidence interval?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              This claim is reasonable, since the entire interval lies above 50%.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The value of 70% lies outside of the interval, so we have convincing evidence that the researcher's conjecture is wrong.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A 90% confidence interval will be narrower than a 95% confidence interval. Even without calculating the interval, we can tell that 70% would not fall in the interval, and we would reject the researcher's conjecture based on a 90% confidence level as well.
