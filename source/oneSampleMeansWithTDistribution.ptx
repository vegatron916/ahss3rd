          <p>
            When is it reasonable to model the sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> using a normal distribution,
            and when will we need to use a new distribution,
            known as the <m>t</m>-distribution?

    <title>Using a normal distribution for inference when <m>\sigma</m> is known</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="distributionofxbar"></xref>
      we saw that the distribution of a sample mean is normal if the population is normal or if the sample size is at least 30.
      In these problems,
      we used the population mean and population standard deviation to find a Z-score.
      However, in the case of inference,
      these values will be unknown.
      In rare circumstances we may know the standard deviation of a population,
      even though we do not know its mean.
      For example, in some industrial processes,
      the mean may be known to shift over time,
      while the standard deviation of the process remains the same.
      In these cases,
      we can use the normal model as the basis for our inference procedures.
      We use <m>\bar{x}</m> as our point estimate for <m>\mu</m> and the <m>SD</m> formula for a sample mean calculated in <xref ref="distributionofxbar"></xref>:
      <m>\sigma_{\bar{x}} =\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m>.
      That leads to a confidence interval and a test statistic as follows:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ CI:  }  \bar{x} \amp \ \pm \ z^{\star}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \amp \amp Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \text{ null value } }{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens if we do not know the population standard deviation <m>\sigma</m>,
      as is usually the case?
      The best we can do is use the sample standard deviation,
      denoted by <m>s</m>, to estimate the population standard deviation.
      <md>
        <mrow>SE= \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when we do this we run into a problem:
      when carrying out our inference procedures,
      we will be trying to estimate <em>two</em> quantities:
      both the mean and the standard deviation.
      Looking at the <m>SD</m> and <m>SE</m> formulas,
      we can make some important observations that will give us a hint as to what will happen when we use <m>s</m> instead of <m>\sigma</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            For a given population, <m>\sigma</m> is a fixed number and does not vary.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>s</m>, the standard deviation of a sample,
            will vary from one sample to the next and will not be exactly equal to <m>\sigma</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The larger the sample size <m>n</m>,
            the better the estimate <m>s</m> will tend to be for <m>\sigma</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason,
      the normal model still works well when the sample size is large.
      For smaller sample sizes, we run into a problem:
      our use of <m>s</m>, which is used when computing the standard error,
      tends to add more variability to our test statistic.
      It is this extra variability that leads us to a new distribution:
      the <m>t</m>-distribution.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="introducingTheTDistribution">
    <title>Introducing the <m>t</m>-distribution</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>t-distribution@<m>t</m>-distribution</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      When we use the sample standard deviation <m>s</m> in place of the population standard deviation <m>\sigma</m> to standardize the sample mean,
      we get an entirely new distribution - one that is similar to the normal distribution,
      but has greater spread.
      This distribution is known as the <m>t</m>-distribution.
      A <m>t</m>-distribution,
      shown as a solid line in <xref ref="tDistCompareToNormalDist"></xref>,
      has a bell shape.
      However, its tails are thicker than the normal model's.
      We can see that a greater proportion of the area under the <m>t</m>-distribution is beyond 2 standard units from 0 than under the normal distribution.
      These extra thick tails are exactly the correction we need to resolve the problem of a poorly estimated standard deviation.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="tDistCompareToNormalDist">
      <caption>Comparison of a <m>t</m>-distribution (solid line) and a normal distribution (dotted line).</caption>
      <image width="60%" source="images/inference_means/tDistCompareToNormalDist.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      The <m>t</m>-distribution,
      always centered at zero, has a single parameter: degrees of freedom.
      The <term>degrees of freedom (df)</term><idx><h>degrees of freedom (df)</h><h><m>t</m>-distribution</h></idx> describes the precise form of the bell-shaped <m>t</m>-distribution.
      Several <m>t</m>-distributions are shown in <xref ref="tDistConvergeToNormalDist"></xref>.
      When there are more degrees of freedom,
      the <m>t</m>-distribution looks more like the standard normal distribution.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="tDistConvergeToNormalDist">
      <caption>The larger the degrees of freedom, the more closely the <m>t</m>-distribution resembles the standard normal distribution.</caption>

    <assemblage>
      <title>Degrees of freedom</title>
      <p>
        The degrees of freedom describes the shape of the <m>t</m>-distribution.
        The larger the degrees of freedom,
        the more closely the distribution resembles the standard normal<nbsp/>distribution.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      When the degrees of freedom is large, about 30 or more,
      the <m>t</m>-distribution is nearly indistinguishable from the normal distribution.
      In <xref ref="tDistSolutionToSEProblem"></xref>,
      we will see how degrees of freedom relates to sample size.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will find it useful to become familiar with the <m>t</m>-distribution,
      because it plays a very similar role to the normal distribution during inference.
      We use a <em><m>t</m>-table</em>,
          <idx><h>t-table@<m>t</m>-table</h></idx>
      partially shown in <xref ref="tTableSample_ch_inf_means"></xref>,
      in place of the normal probability table when the population standard deviation is unknown,
      especially when the sample size is small.
      A<nbsp/>larger table is presented in <xref ref="tDistributionTable_section"></xref>.

    <p>
      Each row in the <m>t</m>-table represents a <m>t</m>-distribution with different degrees of freedom.
      The columns correspond to tail probabilities.
      For instance,
      if we know we are working with the <m>t</m>-distribution with <m>df=18</m>,
      we can examine row 18,
      which is <em>highlighted</em> in <xref ref="tTableSample_ch_inf_means"></xref>.
      If we want the value in this row that identifies the cutoff for an upper tail of 10%, we can look in the column where
      <em>one tail</em> is 0.100.
      This cutoff is 1.33.
      If we had wanted the cutoff for the lower 10%, we would use -1.33.
      Just like the normal distribution,
      all <m>t</m>-distributions are symmetric.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What proportion of the <m>t</m>-distribution with 18 degrees of freedom falls below -2.10?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Just like a normal probability problem,
          we first draw a picture as shown in <xref ref="tDistDF18LeftTail2Point10"></xref>
          and shade the area below -2.10.
          To find this area, we identify the appropriate row: <m>df=18</m>.
          Then we identify the column containing the absolute value of -2.10;
          it is the third column.
          Because we are looking for just one tail,
          we examine the top line of the table,
          which shows that a one tail area for a value in the third row corresponds to 0.025.
          That is, 2.5% of the distribution falls below -2.10.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For the <m>t</m>-distribution with 18 degrees of freedom,
          what percent of the curve is contained between -1.330 and +1.330?

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Using row <m>df = 18</m>, we find 1.330 in the table.
          The area in each tail is 0.100 for a total of 0.200,
          which leaves 0.800 in the middle between -1.33 and +1.33.
          This corresponds to the 80%, which can be found at the very bottom of that column.

          what should the value of <m>t^{\star}</m> be so that 95% of the area of the curve falls between -<m>t^{\star}</m> and +<m>t^{\star}</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can look at the column in the <m>t</m>-table that says 95% along the bottom row and trace it up to row <m>df = 3</m> to find that <m>t^{\star} = 3.182</m>.

          Estimate the proportion of the distribution falling above 1.65.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We identify the row in the <m>t</m>-table using the degrees of freedom:
          <m>df=20</m>.
          Then we look for 1.65; it is not listed.
          It falls between the first and second columns.
          Since these values bound 1.65,
          their tail areas will bound the tail area corresponding to 1.65.
          We identify the one tail area of the first and second columns, 0.050 and 0.10,
          and we conclude that between 5% and 10% of the distribution is more than 1.65 standard deviations above the mean.
          If we like, we can identify the precise area using statistical software: 0.0573.

    <title>Checking conditions for inference on a mean using the <m>t</m>-distribution</title>
    <p>
      Using the <m>t</m>-distribution for inference on a mean requires that the theoretical <em>sampling distribution for the sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> is nearly normal.</em>.
      In practice,
      we check whether these assumptions are reasonable by verifying that certain conditions are met.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <alert>Independent.</alert> Observations can be considered independent when the data are collected from a <em>random process</em>, such as rolling a die, or from a <em>random sample</em>. Without a random sample or process, the standard error formula would not apply, and it is unclear to what population the inference would apply. Recall that when sampling without replacement from a finite population, the observations can be considered independent when sampling less than 10% of the population.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <alert>Sample size / nearly normal population.</alert> We saw in <xref ref="distributionofxbar"></xref> that in order for the sampling distribution for a sample mean to be nearly normal, we also need the sample to be drawn from a nearly normal population or we need the sample size to be at least 30 (<m>n\ge 30</m>).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      What should we do when the sample size is small and we are not sure whether the population distribution is nearly normal?
      In this case,
      the best we can do is look at the data for excessive skew.
      If the data are very skewed or have obvious outliers,
      this suggests that the sample did not come from a nearly normal population.
      However, if the data do not show obvious skew or outliers,
      then the idea of a nearly normal population is generally considered <em>reasonable</em>,
      making the assumption of a nearly normal sampling distribution for <m>\bar{x}</m> reasonable as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that by looking at a small data set,
      we cannot <em>prove</em> that the population distribution is nearly normal.
      However, the data can suggest to us whether the population distribution being nearly normal is an unreasonable assumption.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>The normality condition with small samples</title>
      <p>
        If the sample is small and there is strong skew or extreme outliers in the data,
        the population from which the sample was drawn may not be nearly normal.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      Ideally, we use a graph of the data to check for strong skew or outliers.
      When the full data set is not available,
      summary statistics can also be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sample size goes up,
      it becomes less necessary to check for skew in the data.
      If the sample size is 30 or more,
      it is no longer necessary that the population distribution be nearly normal.
      When the sample size is large,
      the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be nearly normal regardless of the distribution of the population.

    <title>One sample <m>t</m>-interval for a mean</title>
    <p>
      Dolphins are at the top of the oceanic food chain,
      which causes dangerous substances such as mercury to concentrate in their organs and muscles.
      This is an important problem for both dolphins and other animals,
      like humans, who eat them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would like to create a confidence interval to estimate the average mercury content in dolphin muscles.
      We will use a sample of 19 Risso's dolphins from the Taiji area in Japan.
      The data are summarized in <xref ref="summaryStatsOfHgInMuscleOfRissosDolphins"></xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we are estimating a mean,
      we would like to construct a <m>t</m>-interval,
      but first we must check whether the conditions for using a <m>t</m>-interval are met.
      We will start by assuming that the sample of 19 Risso's dolphins constitutes a random sample.
      Next, we note that the sample size is small
      (less than 30),
      and we do not know whether the distribution of mercury content for all dolphins is nearly normal.
      Therefore, we must look at the data.
      Since we do not have all of the data to graph,
      we look at the summary statistics provided in <xref ref="summaryStatsOfHgInMuscleOfRissosDolphins"></xref>.
      These summary statistics do not suggest any strong skew or outliers;
      all observations are within 2.5 standard deviations of the mean.
      Based on this evidence,
      we believe it is reasonable that the population distribution of mercury content in dolphins could be nearly normal.

      With both conditions met, we will construct a 95% confidence interval.
      Recall that a confidence interval has the following form:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ point estimate }  \ \pm\  \text{ critical value } \times SE\text{ of estimate }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The point estimate is the sample mean and the <m>SE</m> of the sample mean is given by <m>s/\sqrt{n}</m>.
      What do we use for the critical value?
      Since we are using the <m>t</m>-distribution,
      we use a <m>t</m>-table to find the critical value.
      We denote the critical value <m>t^{\star}</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            For a 95% confidence interval,
            we want to find the cutoff
            <m>t^{\star}</m> such that 95% of the <m>t</m>-distribution is between -<m>t^{\star}</m> and <m>t^{\star}</m>.

      <solution>
        <p>
          To find the critical value
          <m>t^{\star}</m> we use the <m>t</m>-distribution with <m>n-1</m> degrees of freedom.
          The sample size is 19, so <m>df=19-1=18</m> degrees of freedom.
          Using the <m>t</m>-table with row <m>df=18</m> and column corresponding to a 95% confidence level,

          A random sample of Risso's dolphins was taken from the Taiji area in Japan.
          The mercury content in the muscles of other types of dolphins and from dolphins from other regions may vary.
          Therefore, we can only make an inference to Risso's dolphins from this area.
          We are 95% confident the true average mercury content in the muscles of Risso's dolphins in the Taiji area of Japan is between 3.29 and 5.51 <m>\mu</m>g/wet gram.

          Based on a sample of 15 croaker white fish (Pacific),
          a sample mean and standard deviation were computed as 0.287 and 0.069 ppm
          (parts per million),
          respectively.
          The 15 observations ranged from 0.18 to 0.41 ppm.
          Construct an appropriate 95% confidence interval for the true average mercury content of croaker white fish (Pacific).
          Is there evidence that the average mercury content is greater than 0.275 ppm?

    <title>Choosing a sample size when estimating a mean</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>margin of error</h></idx>
      In <xref ref="moeproportion"></xref>, we looked at sample size considerations when estimating a proportion.
      We take the same approach when estimating a mean.
      Recall that the margin of error is measured as the distance between the point estimate and the upper or lower bound of the confidence interval.
      We want to estimate a mean with a particular confidence level while putting an upper bound on the margin of error.
      What is the smallest sample size that will satisfy these conditions?
    </p>
    <p>
      For a one sample <m>t</m>-interval,
      the margin of error, <m>ME</m>,
      is given by <m>ME = t^{\star}\times\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}</m>.
      The challenge in this case is that we need to know <m>n</m> to find <m>t^{\star}</m>.
      But <m>n</m> is precisely what we are attempting to solve for!
      Fortunately,
      in most cases we will have a reasonable estimate for the population standard deviation and the desired <m>n</m> will be large,
      so we can use <m>ME = z^{\star}\times\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m>,
      making it easier to solve for <m>n</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Blood pressure oscillates with the beating of the heart,
          and the systolic pressure is defined as the peak pressure when a person is at rest.
          The standard deviation of systolic blood pressure for people in the U.S. is about 25 mmHg
          (millimeters of mercury).
          How large of a sample is necessary to estimate the average systolic blood pressure of people in a particular town with a margin of error no greater than 4 mmHg using a 95% confidence level?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution xml:id="sampleSizeComputationForSystolicBloodPressure">
        <p>
          For this problem,
          we want to find the sample size <m>n</m> so that the margin of error,
          <m>ME</m>,
          is less than or equal to 4 mmHg.
          We start by writing the following inequality:
          <md>
            <mrow>z^{\star}\times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq 4</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          For a 95% confidence level, the critical value <m>z^{\star}=1.96</m>.
          Our best estimate for the population standard deviation is <m>\sigma = 25</m>.
          We substitute in these two values and we solve for <m>n</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>1.96\times\frac{25}{\sqrt{n}} \amp \leq 4</mrow>
            <mrow>1.96\times\frac{25}{4} \amp \leq \sqrt{n}</mrow>
            <mrow>\left(1.96\times\frac{25}{4}\right)^2 \amp \leq n</mrow>
            <mrow>150.06 \amp \leq n</mrow>
            <mrow>n \amp = 151</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The minimum sample size that meets the condition is 151.
          We round up because the sample size must be an integer and it must be
          <em>greater than or equal to</em> 150.06.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Identify a sample size for a particular margin of error</title>
      <p>
        To estimate the minimum sample size required to achieve a margin of error less than or equal to <m>m</m>,
        with C% confidence, we set up an inequality as follows:
        <md>
          <mrow>z^{\star}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\leq m</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>z^{\star}</m> depends on the desired confidence level and <m>\sigma</m> is the standard deviation associated with the population.
        We solve for the sample size, <m>n</m>.

      Sample size computations are helpful in planning data collection,

      Is the typical U.S. runner getting faster or slower over time?
      Technological advances in shoes,
      training, and diet might suggest runners would be faster.
      An opposing viewpoint might say that with the average body mass index on the rise,
      people tend to run slower.
      In fact, all of these components might be influencing run time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We consider this question in the context of the Cherry Blossom Race,
      which is a 10-mile race in Washington, DC each<nbsp/>spring.
      The average time for all runners who finished the Cherry Blossom Race in 2006 was 93.3 minutes (93 minutes and about 18 seconds).
      We want to determine using data from 100 participants in the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race whether runners in this race are getting faster or slower,

      <solution>
        <p>
          We know that the average run time for all runners in 2006 was 93.3 minutes.
          We have a sample of times from the 2017 race.
          We are interested in whether the average run time has <em>changed</em>,
          so we will use a two-sided <m>H_A</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>\mu</m> represent the average 10-mile run time of all participants in 2017,which is unknown to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>H_0</m>: <m>\mu = 93.3</m> minutes. The average run time of all participants in 2017 was 93.3 min.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>H_A</m>: <m>\mu \neq 93.3</m> minutes. The average run time of all participants in 2017 was not 93.3 min.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <p>
      The data come from a random sample from a large population,
      so the observations are independent.
      Do we need to check for skew in the data?
      No <mdash/> with a sample size of 100, well over 30,
      the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> will be nearly normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      With independence satisfied and slight skew not a concern for this large of a sample,
      we can proceed with performing a hypothesis test using the <m>t</m>-distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the 100 runners from the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race are 97.3 and 17.0 minutes,
      respectively.
      We want to know whether the observed sample mean of 97.3 is far enough away from 93.3 to provide convincing evidence of a real difference,
      or if it is within the realm of expected variation for a sample of size 100.
    </p>
    <p>
      To answer this question we will find the test statistic and p-value for the hypothesis test.
      Since we will be using a sample standard deviation in our calculation of the test statistic,
      we will need to use a <m>t</m>-distribution,
      just as we did with confidence intervals for a mean.
      We call the test statistic a <m>T</m>-statistic.
      It has the same general form as a Z-statistic.
      <md>
        <mrow>T = \frac{\text{ point estimate }  - \text{ null value } }{SE\text{ of estimate } }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      As we saw before, when carrying out inference on a single mean,
      the degrees of freedom is given by <m>n-1</m>.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>The T-statistic</title>
      <p>
        The <term>T-statistic</term>
        (or T-score)
        is analogous to a Z-statistic
        (or Z-score).
        Both represent how many standard errors the observed value is from the null value.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate the test statistic,
          degrees of freedom, and p-value for this test.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Here, our point estimate is the sample mean,
          <m>\bar{x}=97.3</m> minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <m>SE</m> of the sample mean is given by <m>\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}</m>,
          so the <m>SE</m> of estimate = <m>\frac{17}{\sqrt{100}} = 1.7</m> minutes.
          <md>
            <mrow>T = \frac{97.3-93.3}{1.7} = 2.35 \qquad df=100-1=99</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a calculator,
          we find that the area above 2.35 under the <m>t</m>-distribution with 99 degrees of freedom is 0.01.
          Because this is a two-tailed test, we double this.
          So the p-value = <m>2\times 0.01 = 0.02</m>.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This depends upon the desired significance level.
          Since the p-value <m>= 0.02 \lt 0.05</m>,
          there is sufficient evidence at the 5% significance level.
          However, as the p-value of <m>0.02 \gt 0.01</m>,
          there is not sufficient evidence at the 1% significance level.

          Would you expect the hypothesized value of 93.3 to fall inside or outside of a 95% confidence interval?

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Because the hypothesized value of 93.3 was rejected by the two-sided <m>\alpha=0.05</m> test,
          we would expect it to be outside the 95% confidence interval.
          However, because the hypothesized value of 93.3 was not rejected by the two-sided <m>\alpha=0.01</m> test,
          we would expect it to fall inside the (wider) 99% confidence interval.

          Discuss whether the conclusion of the hypothesis test in the previous example is consistent or inconsistent with the conclusion of the confidence interval.
          <fn>It is consistent because 0.25 is located (just barely) inside the confidence interval, so it is considered a reasonable value. Our hypothesis test did not reject the hypothesis that <m>\mu = 0.25</m>, also implying that it is a reasonable value. Note that the p-value was just over the cutoff of 0.05. This is consistent with the value of 0.25 being just inside the confidence interval. Also note that the hypothesis test did not <em>prove</em> that <m> \mu= 0.25</m>. The value 0.25 is just one of many reasonable values for the true mean.</fn>

          The <m>t</m>-distribution.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                When calculating a test statistic for a mean,
                using the sample standard deviation in place of the population standard deviation gives rise to a new distribution called the <m>t</m>-distribution.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                As the sample size and degrees of freedom increase,
                <m>s</m> becomes a more stable estimate of <m>\sigma</m>,
                and the corresponding <m>t</m>-distribution has smaller spread.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                As the degrees of freedom go to <m>\infty</m>,
                the <m>t</m>-distribution approaches the normal distribution.
                This is why we can use the <m>t</m>-table at
                <m>df=\infty</m> to find the value of <m>z^{\star}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When carrying out inference for a single mean,
          we use the <m>t</m>-distribution with <m>n-1</m> degrees of freedom.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When there is one sample and the parameter of interest is a single mean:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Estimate <m>\mu</m> at the C% confidence level using a
                <term>1-sample t-interval</term>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Test <m>H_0</m>:
                <m>\mu=\mu_0</m> at the <m>\alpha</m> significance level using a
                <term>1-sample t-test</term>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The one-sample t-interval and t-test require that the sampling distribution for <m>\bar{x}</m> be nearly normal. For this reason we must check that the following conditions are met.
          <ol marker="1.">
            <li>
            <p>
              Independence: Data come from a random sample or random process. When sampling without replacement, check that sample size is less than 10% of the population size.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Large sample or normal population: <m>n\ge 30</m>  or the population distr. is nearly normal. If the sample size is less than 30 and the population distribution is unknown, check for strong skew or outliers in the data. If neither is found, the condition that the population distribution is nearly normal is considered reasonable.
            </p>
          </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When the conditions are met,
          we calculate the confidence interval and the test statistic as we did in the previous chapter,
          except that we use <m>t^{\star}</m> for the critical value and we use <m>T</m> for the test statistic.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Confidence interval:<nbsp/> <m>\text{ point estimate } \ \pm\ t^{\star} \times SE\ \text{ of estimate }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Test statistic:
                <m>T = \frac{\text{ point estimate } - \text{ null value } }{SE \text{ of estimate } }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here the point estimate is the sample mean: <m>\bar{x}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <m>SE</m> of estimate is the <m>SE</m> of the sample mean:
          <m>\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The degrees of freedom is given by <m>df = n-1</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To calculate the minimum sample size required to estimate a mean with C% confidence and a margin of error no greater than <m>m</m>,
          we set up an inequality as follows:
          <md>
            <mrow>z^{\star}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\leq m</mrow>
          </md>
          <m>z^{\star}</m> depends on the desired confidence level and <m>\sigma</m> is the standard deviation associated with the population.
          We solve for the sample size, <m>n</m>.
          Always round the answer up to the next <em>integer</em>,
          since <m>n</m> refers to a number of people or things.
