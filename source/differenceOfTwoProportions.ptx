    <title>Sampling distribution for the difference of two proportions (review)</title>
    <p>
      In this section we want to compare proportions from two independent groups. When comparing two proportions, the quantity that we generally want to estimate is the difference <m>p_1-p_2</m>, which tells us how far apart the two population proportions are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we perform inference for the two proportion case, we must review the sampling distribution for <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m>, which will represent our point estimate. We know from LINK that when the independence condition is satisfied, the sampling distribution for <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> is centered on <m>p_{1}-p_{2}</m> and the standard deviation is given by:
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \sigma_{\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{p_{1}(1-p_{1})}{n_{1}} + \frac{p_{2}(1-p_{2})}{n_{2}} }
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the individual population proportions are unknown, we estimate the standard deviation of <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> using the Standard Error, abbreviated SE. The SE of <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> is found by substituting in our best estimates of p1 and p2 using the sample values:
      <md>
        <mrow>
          SE_{\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_{1}} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_{2}} }
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference of two sample proportions <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> follows a nearly normal distribution when two conditions are met. First, the sampling distribution for each sample proportion must be nearly normal. Second, the observations must be independent, both within and between groups. We cover these conditions in greater detail next.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Checking conditions for inference using a normal distribution</title>
    <p>
      When comparing two proportions,
      we carry out inference on <m>p_1-p_2</m>.
      The assumptions are that the observations are independent,
      both between groups and within groups and that the <alert>sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> is nearly normal</alert>, and this assumption is reasonable when two conditions are met:
    </p>
    <p>
    	<alert>Independence.</alert> The observations across the two samples are independent. This condition is generally satisfied by checking whether the data are collected from two independent random samples or from an experiment with two randomly assigned treatments. Randomly assigning subjects to treatments is equivalent to randomly assigning treatments to subjects. When sampling without replacement, the observations can be considered independent when the sample sizes is less than 10% of the population size for both samples.
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>Success-failure condition.</alert> In the two-sample case, the number of successes and failures should be at least 10 for both groups, so there are four inequalities to check.
    </p>

    <title>Confidence interval for the difference of two proportions</title>
    <p>
      We consider an experiment for patients who underwent CPR for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital.
      These patients were randomly divided into a treatment group where they received a blood thinner or the control group where they did not receive a blood thinner.
      The outcome variable of interest was whether the patients survived for at least 24 hours.
      The results are shown in <xref ref="resultsForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSection"></xref>.

    <p>
      Here, the parameter of interest is a difference of population proportions,
      specifically,
      the difference in the proportion of similar patients that would survive for at least 24 hours if in the treatment group versus if in the control group.
      Let:
      <md>
        <mrow>p_1:\amp  \text{ proportion that would survive in treatment group, and }</mrow>
        <mrow>p_2:\amp  \text{ proportion that would survive in control group }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the parameter of interest is <m>p_1 - p_2</m>.
      In order to use a Z-interval to estimate this difference,
      we must see if the point estimate,
      <m>\hat{p}_{1} - \hat{p}_{2}</m>,
      follows a normal distribution.
      Because the patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups and one heart attack patient is unlikely to influence the next that was in the study,
      the observations are considered independent,
      both within the samples and between the samples.
      Next, the success-failure condition should be verified for each group.
      We use the sample proportions along with the sample<nbsp/>sizes to check the condition.
      <md>
        <mrow>n_1\hat{p}_1\amp \ge 10 \amp  n_1(1-\hat{p}_1)\amp \ge 10 \amp  n_2\hat{p}_2\amp \ge 10 \amp  n_2(1-\hat{p}_2)\amp \ge 10</mrow>
        <mrow>40 \times \frac{14}{40} \amp \ge 10 \amp 40 \times (1-\frac{14}{40}) \amp \ge 10 \amp 50 \times \frac{11}{50} \amp \ge 10 \amp 50 \times (1-\frac{11}{50}) \amp \ge 10</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because all conditions are met,
      the normal model can be used for the point estimate of the difference in survival rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point estimate is:
      <md>
        <mrow>\hat{p}_{1} - \hat{p}_{2} = \frac{14}{40} - \frac{11}{50} = 0.35 - 0.22 = 0.13</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We compute the standard error for the difference of sample proportions in the same way that we compute the standard deviation for the difference of sample proportions <mdash/> the only difference is that we use the sample proportions in place of the population proportions:
      <md>
        <mrow>SE \amp = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}= \sqrt{\frac{0.35 (1 - 0.35)}{40} + \frac{0.22 (1 - 0.22)}{50}} = 0.095</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us estimate the true difference in survival rate with 90% confidence.
      For a 90% confidence level, we use <m>z^{\star} = 1.645</m>.
      The 90% confidence interval is calculated as:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ point estimate } \pm\amp z^{\star} \times SE\ \text{ of estimate }</mrow>
        <mrow>0.13 \pm\amp 1.65\times 0.095</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp (-0.027, 0.287)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We are 90% confident that the true difference in the survival rate
      (treatment <m>-</m> control)
      lies between -0.027 and 0.095.
      That is, we are 90% confident that the treatment of blood thinners changes survival rate for patients like those in the study by <m>-2.7\%</m> to <m>+28.7\%</m> percentage points.
      Because this interval contains both negative and positive values,
      we do not have enough information to say with confidence whether blood thinners harm or help heart attack patients who have been admitted after they have undergone CPR.

      <statement>
        <p>
          A remote control car company is considering a new manufacturer for wheel gears.
          The new manufacturer would be more expensive but their higher quality gears are more reliable,
          resulting in happier customers and fewer warranty claims.
          However, management must be convinced that the more expensive gears are worth the conversion before they approve the switch.
          The quality control engineer collects a sample of gears,
          examining 1000 gears from each company and finds that 879 gears pass inspection from the current supplier and 958 pass inspection from the prospective supplier.
          Using these data,
          construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportion from each supplier that would pass inspection.
          Use the five step framework described above to organize your work.

      <solution>
        <p>
        	<em>Identify</em>: First we identify the parameter of interest.
          	Here the parameter we wish to estimate is the true difference in the proportion of gears from each supplier that would pass inspection,
          	<m>p_1-p_2</m>.
          	We will take the difference as:
          	current <m>-</m> prospective,
          	so <m>p_1</m> is the true proportion that would pass from the current supplier and <m>p_2</m> is the true proportion that would pass from the prospective supplier.
        	We will estimate the difference using a 95% confidence level.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		<em>Choose</em>: Because the parameter to be estimated is a difference of proportions,
          	we will use a 2-proportion Z-interval.

         <p>
         	<em>Check</em>: The samples are independent,
          	but not necessarily random,
          	so to proceed we must assume the gears are all independent.
          	For this sample we will suppose this assumption is reasonable,
          	but the engineer would be more knowledgeable as to whether this assumption is appropriate.
          	We also must verify the minimum sample size conditions:

	    	<em>Calculate</em>: We will calculate the interval:

	        </md>
        </p>
        <p>
        	The point estimate is the difference of sample proportions:
          	<m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2 = 0.879 - 0.958 = -0.079</m>.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	       	The <m>SE</m> of the difference of sample proportions is:

	       	<m>\sqrt{\frac{\ \hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)\ }{n_1}+ \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}\ } = \sqrt{\frac{0.879(1-0.879)}{1000} +\frac{0.958(1-0.958)}{1000}}= 0.0121</m>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	       	So the 95% confidence interval is given by:

	    </p>
        <p>
        	<em>Conclude</em>: We are 95% confident that the true difference (current <m>-</m> prospective) in the proportion that would pass inspection is between -0.103 and -0.055,
          	meaning that we are 95% confident that the prospective supplier would have between a 5.5% and 10.3% <em>greater</em> rate of passing inspection.
        	Because the entire interval is below zero,
        	the data provide sufficient evidence that the prospective gears pass inspection more often than the current gears.
        	The remote control car company should go with the new manufacturer.

    <title>Hypothesis testing when <m>H_0</m>: <m>p_1 = p_2</m></title>
    <p>
      Here we use a new example to examine a special estimate of the standard error when the null hypothesis is that two population proportions equal each other, i.e.
      <m>H_0</m>: <m>p_1 = p_2</m>.
      We investigate whether the way a question is phrased can influence a person's response.
      Pew Research Center conducted a survey with the following question:<fn><url href="https://www.people-press.org/2012/03/26/public-remains-split-on-health-care-bill-opposed-to-mandate/">https://www.people-press.org/2012/03/26/public-remains-split-on-health-care-bill-opposed-to-mandate/</url>.

          Is this study an experiment or an observational study?
          <fn>There is a random sample involved,
          but there are also two treatments.
          Half of the the respondents are given the original statement order and the other half,
          randomly,
          are given the reversed statement order.
          This is an experiment because there are randomly assigned treatments.</fn>

    <p>
      The approval percents of 47% and 34% seem far apart.
      However, could this difference be due to random chance?
      We will answer this question using a hypothesis test.
      To simplify things, let
      <md>
        <mrow>p_1\amp  \text{ : the proportion of respondents that would approve of policy with the original statement ordering, and }</mrow>
        <mrow>p_2\amp  \text{ : the proportion of respondents that would approve of policy with the reversed statement ordering. }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Set up hypotheses to test whether the two statement orders produce the same response.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The null claim is that the question order does not matter, that is,
          that the two proportions should be equal.
          The alternate claim, the one that bears the burden of proof,
          is that the question ordering does matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>H_0</m>: <m>p_1 = p_2</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>H_A</m>: <m>p_1 \ne p_2</m>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Now, we can note that:
      <md>
        <mrow>p_1=p_2 \amp \text{ is equivalent to }  p_1-p_2=0\text{ , and }</mrow>
        <mrow>p_1\ne p_2 \amp \text{ is equivalent to }  p_1-p_2\ne 0</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can now see that the hypotheses are really about a difference of proportions:
      <m>p_1-p_2</m>.
      In the last section,
      we used a 2-proportion Z-interval to estimate the parameter <m>p_1-p_2</m>;
      here, we will use a 2-proportion Z-test to test the null hypothesis that
      <m>p_1-p_2=0</m>, i.e. that <m>p_1=p_2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that the test statistic Z has the form:
      <md>
        <mrow>Z = \frac{\text{ point estimate }  - \text{ null value } }{SE\ \text{ of estimate } }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter of interest is <m>p_1-p_2</m>,
      so the point estimate will be the observed difference of sample proportions:
      <m>\hat{p}_{1} - \hat{p}_{2} = 0.47 - 0.34 = 0.13</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The null value depends on the null hypothesis.
      The null hypothesis is that the approval rate would be the same for both statement orderings,
      i.e. that the difference is 0, therefore, the null value is 0.
      In this section we consider only the case where <m>H_0</m>:
      <m>p_1=p_2</m>,
      so the null value for the difference will always be 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <m>SD</m> of a difference of sample proportions has the form:
      <md>
        <mrow>SD = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in a hypothesis test,
      the distribution of the point estimate is always examined assuming the null hypothesis is true,
      i.e. in this case, <m>p_1 = p_2</m>.
      Both the success-failure check and the standard error formula should reflect this equality in the null hypothesis.
      We will use <m>p_c</m> to represent the common proportion that support healthcare law regardless of statement order:
      <md>
        <mrow>SD \amp = \sqrt{\frac{p_c(1-p_c)}{n_1} + \frac{p_c(1-p_c)}{n_2}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \sqrt{p_c(1-p_c)}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We don't know the true proportion <m>p_c</m>,
      but we can obtain a good estimate of it,
      <m>\hat{p}_c</m>, by <em>pooling</em> the results of both samples.
      We find the total number of <q>yeses</q> or <q>successes</q> and divide that by the total number of cases.
      This is equivalent to taking a weighted average of <m>\hat{p}_1</m> and <m>\hat{p}_2</m>.
      We call <m>\hat{p}_c</m> the <term>pooled sample proportion</term>,
      and we use it to check the success-failure condition and to compute the standard error when the null hypothesis is that <m>p_1 = p_2</m>.
      Here:
      <me>
        \hat{p}_c = \frac{771(0.47) + 732(0.34)}{771+732}= 0.407
      </me>
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Pooled sample proportion</title>
      <p>
        When the null hypothesis is <m>p_1 = p_2</m>,
        it is useful to find the pooled sample proportion:
        <md>
        	<mrow>\hat{p}_c = \frac{\text{ number of “successes” } }{\text{ number of cases } } = \frac{\text{x} _1+\text{x} _2}{n_1+n_2}=\frac{n_1\hat{p}_1 + n_2\hat{p}_2}{n_1 + n_2}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here <m>\text{x} _1</m> represents the number of successes in sample 1.
        If <m>\text{x} _1</m> is not given,
        it can be computed as <m>n_1\times \hat{p}_1</m>.
        Similarly, <m>\text{x} _2</m> represents the number of successes in sample<nbsp/>2 and can be computed as <m>n_2\times \hat{p}_2</m>.

    	<title>Use the pooled sample proportion when <m>H_0</m>:
        <m>{p}_1 = {p}_2</m></title>
      	<p>
      		When the null hypothesis states that the proportions are equal,
        	we use the pooled sample proportion (<m>\hat{p}_c</m>) to check the success-failure condition and to estimate the standard error:
        	<mdn>
          		<mrow xml:id="seOfDiffInPropUsingPooledEstimate">SE =\sqrt{\hat{p}_c(1-\hat{p}_c)}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}</mrow>

      	</p>
    </assemblage>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Verify that conditions for using the normal are met and find the <m>SE</m> of estimate for this hypothesis test.
          Recall that the pooled proportion <m>\hat{p}_c=0.407</m>,
          <m>n_1 = 771</m>, and <m>n_2=732</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The data do come from two randomly assigned treatments,
          where the treatments are the two different orderings of the question regarding healthcare.
          Also, the success-failure condition
          (minimums of 10)
          easily holds for each group.
          <md>

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, we compute the <m>SE</m> for the difference of sample proportions as:
          <me>
            SE =\sqrt{\hat{p}_c(1-\hat{p}_c)}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}=\sqrt{0.407(1-0.407)}\sqrt{\frac{1}{771} + \frac{1}{732}}=0.025

          Complete the hypothesis test using a significance level of 0.01.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We have already set up the hypotheses and verified that the difference of proportions can be modeled using a normal distribution.
          We can now calculate the test statistic and p-value.
          <md>
          	<mrow>Z = \frac{\text{ point estimate }  - \text{ null value } }{SE\ \text{ of estimate } }= \frac{(0.47-0.34) - 0}{0.025} = 5.2</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a two-tailed test as <m>H_A</m> is that <m>p_1\ne p_2</m>.
          We can find the area in one tail and double it.
          Here, the p-value <m>\approx</m> 0.
          Because the p-value is smaller than <m>\alpha = 0.01</m>,
          we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the order of the statements affects how likely a respondent is to support the 2010 healthcare law.

          A 5-year experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of fish oils on reducing heart attacks,
          where each subject was randomized into one of two treatment groups.
          We'll consider heart attack outcomes in these patients:

            <em>Identify</em>: Define <m>p_1</m> and <m>p_2</m> as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>p_1</m>: the true proportion that would suffer a heart attack if given fish oil

            <m>p_2</m>: the true proportion that would suffer a heart attack if given placebo
          </p>
          <p>
            We will test the following hypotheses at the <m>\alpha=0.10</m> significance level.
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>H_0</m>: <m>p_1=p_2</m> Fish oil and placebo are equally effective.

        <p>
        	<em>Choose</em>: Because we are testing whether two proportions equal each other, we choose the 2-proportion Z-test.
        </p>
        <p>
        	<em>Check</em>: We must verify that the difference of sample proportions can be modeled using a normal distribution.
            First we note that there are two randomly assigned treatments.
            Second, we calculate the pooled proportion as follows:
            <me>
              \hat{p}_c = \frac{x_1+x _2}{n_1+n_2}=\frac{145 + 200}{12933 + 12938}=0.0133
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            We can now verify: <m>12933(0.0133)\geq10</m>,
            <m>12933(1-0.0133)\geq10</m>,
            <m>12938(0.0133)\geq10</m>, and <m>12938(1-0.0133)\geq10</m>,
            so both conditions are met.
           </p>
           <p>
            	<em>Calculate</em>: We will calculate the Z-statistic and the p-value.
            <md>
              <mrow>Z = \frac{\text{ point estimate }  - \text{ null value } }{SE \text{ of estimate } }</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            The point estimate is the difference of sample proportions:
            <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2 = 0.0112 - 0.0155 = -0.0043</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The value hypothesized for the parameter in <m>H_0</m> is the null value:
            null value = 0.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pooled proportion, calculated above, is:
            <m>\hat{p}_c = 0.0133</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <m>SE</m> of the difference of sample proportions,
            assuming <m>H_0</m> is true, is:
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>\sqrt{\hat{p}_c(1-\hat{p}_c)}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}} = \sqrt{0.0133(1-0.0133)}\sqrt{\frac{1}{12933} + \frac{1}{12938}}=0.00142</m>.
            <md>
              <mrow>Z = \frac{-0.0043 - 0}{0.00142} = -3.0</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            Because <m>H_A</m> uses a less than,
            meaning that it is a lower-tail test,
            the p-value is the area to the <em>left</em>
            of <m>Z=-3.0</m> under the standard normal curve.
            This area can be found using a normal table or a calculator.
            The area or p-value = <m>0.0013</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	<em>Conclude</em>: The p-value of 0.0013 is
            <m>\lt 0.10</m>, so we reject <m>H_0</m>;
            there is sufficient evidence that fish oil is effective in reducing heart attacks.

    <title>Section summary</title>
    <p>
      In the previous section, we looked at inference for a single proportion.
      In this section, we <em>compared</em>
      two groups to each other with respect to a proportion or a percent.
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We are interested in whether the true proportion of yeses is the same or different between two distinct groups.
          Call these proportions <m>p_1</m> and <m>p_2</m>.
          The difference,
          <m>p_1-p_2</m> tells us whether <m>p_1</m> is greater than,
          less than, or equal to <m>p_2</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When <em>comparing</em> two proportions to each other,
          the parameter of interest is the
          <em>difference of proportions</em>,
          <m>p_1-p_2</m>, and we use the difference of sample proportions,
          <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m>, as the
          <em>point estimate</em>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The sampling distribution of
          <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> is nearly normal when the success-failure condition is met for <em>both</em>
          groups and when the data is collected using 2 independent random samples or 2 randomly assigned treatments.
          When the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> is nearly normal,
          the standardized test statistic also follows a
          <term>normal</term> distribution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When the null hypothesis is that the two populations proportions are
          <em>equal</em> to each other,
          use the <term>pooled sample proportion</term>
          <m>\hat{p}_c=\frac{x_1+x_2}{n_1+n_2}</m>,
          i.e. the combined number of yeses over the combined sample<nbsp/>sizes,
          when verifying the success-failure condition and when finding the <m>SE</m>.
          For the confidence interval, do not use the pooled sample proportion;
          use the separate values of
          <m>\hat{p}_1</m> and <m>\hat{p}_2</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When there are two samples or treatments and the parameter of interest is a difference of proportions,
          e.g. the true difference in proportion of 17 and 18 year olds with a summer job (proportion of 18 year olds <m>-</m> proportion of 17 year olds):
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Estimate <m>p_1-p_2</m> at the C% confidence level using a
              <term>2-proportion Z-interval</term>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Test <m>H_0</m>: <m>p_1-p_2=0</m> (i.e.
              <m>p_1=p_2</m>) at the <m>\alpha</m> significance level using a
              <term>2-proportion Z-test</term>.

        Explain why the sampling distribution of the difference between the proportions of interventions under provocative and conservative scenarios does not follow an approximately normal distribution.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        This is not a randomized experiment, and it is unclear whether people would be affected by the behavior of their peers. That is, independence may not hold. Additionally, there are only 5 interventions under the provocative scenario, so the success-failure condition does not hold. Even if we consider a hypothesis test where we pool the proportions, the success-failure condition will not be satisfied. Since one condition is questionable and the other is not satisfied, the difference in sample proportions will not follow a nearly normal distribution.

        The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan.
        Each patient entering the program was officially designated a heart transplant candidate,
        meaning that he was gravely ill and might benefit from a new heart.
        Patients were randomly assigned into treatment and control groups.
        Patients in the treatment group received a transplant,

              The title of this newspaper article makes it sound like using prenatal vitamins can prevent autism, which is a causal statement. Since this is an observational study, we cannot make causal statements based on the findings of the study. A more accurate title would be <q>Mothers who use prenatal vitamins before pregnancy are found to have children with a lower rate of autism</q>.

    <title>HIV in sub-Saharan Africa</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In July 2008 the US National Institutes of Health announced that it was stopping a clinical study early because of unexpected results.
        The study population consisted of HIV-infected women in sub-Saharan Africa who had been given single dose Nevaripine (a treatment for HIV) while giving birth,
        to prevent transmission of HIV to the infant.
        The study was a randomized comparison of continued treatment of a woman
        (after successful childbirth)
        with Nevaripine vs Lopinavir,
        a second drug used to treat HIV. 240 women participated in the study; 120 were randomized to each of the two treatments.
        Twenty-four weeks after starting the study treatment,
        each woman was tested to determine if the HIV infection was becoming worse
        (an outcome called <em>virologic failure</em>).
        Twenty-six of the 120 women treated with Nevaripine experienced virologic failure,
        while 10 of the 120 women treated with the other drug experienced virologic failure.

              Random assignment was used, so the observations in each group are independent. If the patients in the study are representative of those in the general population (something impossible to check with the given information), then we can also confidently generalize the findings to the population. The success-failure condition, which we would check using the pooled proportion <m>(\hat{p}_{pool} = 36/240 = 0.15)</m>, is satisfied. <m>Z = 2.89 \rightarrow \text{p-value } = 0.0039</m>. Since the p-value is low, we reject <m>H_{0}</m>. There is strong evidence of a difference in virologic failure rates between the Nevaripine and Lopinavir groups. Treatment and virologic failure do not appear to be independent.

    <title>An apple a day keeps the doctor away</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A physical education teacher at a high school wanting to increase awareness on issues of nutrition and health asked her students at the beginning of the semester whether they believed the expression
        <q>an apple a day keeps the doctor away</q>, and 40% of the students responded yes.
        Throughout the semester she started each class with a brief discussion of a study highlighting positive effects of eating more fruits and vegetables.
        She conducted the same apple-a-day survey at the end of the semester,
        and this time 60% of the students responded yes.
        Can she used a two-proportion method from this section for this analysis?
        Explain your reasoning.
