  <title>Speeding on the I-5, Part I</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The distribution of passenger vehicle speeds traveling on the Interstate 5 Freeway (I-5) in California is nearly normal with a mean of 72.6 miles/hour and a standard deviation of 4.78 miles/hour.<fn>S. Johnson and D.

  <title>University admissions</title><!--  #47 -->
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose a university announced that it admitted 2,500 students for the following year's freshman class. However, the university has dorm room spots for only 1,786 freshman students. If there is a 70% chance that an admitted student will decide to accept the offer and attend this university, what is the approximate probability that the university will not have enough dormitory room spots for the freshman class?

    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Want to find the probability that there will be 1,786 or more enrollees. Using the normal approximation, with <m>\mu= np = 2,500 \times 0.7 = 1750</m> and <m>\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p} = \sqrt{2,500 \times 0.7 \times 0.3} \approx 23</m>, <m>Z = 1.61</m>, and <m>P(Z > 1.61) = 0.0537</m>.

  <title>SAT scores</title><!--  #50 -->
    <statement>
      <p>
        SAT scores (out of 1600) are distributed normally with a mean of 1100 and a standard deviation of 200. Suppose a school council awards a certificate of excellence to all students who score at least 1350 on the SAT, and suppose we pick one of the recognized students at random. What is the probability this student's score will be at least 1500? (The material covered in Section 3.2 would be useful for this question.)

  <title>Buying books on Ebay</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The textbook you need to buy for your chemistry class is expensive at the college bookstore, so you consider buying it on Ebay instead. A look at past auctions suggest that the prices of that chemistry textbook have an approximately normal distribution with mean $89 and standard deviation $15.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              What is the probability that a randomly selected auction for this book closes at more than $100?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Ebay allows you to set your maximum bid price so that if someone outbids you on an auction you can automatically outbid them, up to the maximum bid price you set. If you are only bidding on one auction, what are the advantages and disadvantages of setting a bid price too high or too low? What if you are bidding on multiple auctions?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you watched 10 auctions, roughly what percentile might you use for a maximum bid cutoff to be somewhat sure that you will win one of these ten auctions? Is it possible to find a cutoff point that will ensure that you win an auction?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you are willing to track up to ten auctions closely, about what price might you use as your maximum bid price if you want to be somewhat sure that you will buy one of these ten books?

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you are bidding on only one auction and set a low maximum bid price, someone will probably outbid you. If you set a high maximum bid price, you may win the auction but pay more than is necessary. If bidding on more than one auction, and you set your maximum bid price very low, you probably won't win any of the auctions. However, if the maximum bid price is even modestly high, you are likely to win multiple auctions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              An answer roughly equal to the 10th percentile would be reasonable. Regrettably, no percentile cutoff point guarantees beyond any possible event that you win at least one auction. However, you may pick a higher percentile if you want to be more sure of winning an auction.
