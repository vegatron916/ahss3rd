        Swaziland has the highest HIV prevalence in the world: 25.9% of this country's population is infected with HIV<fn>Source: CIA Factbook, <url href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html">Country Comparison: HIV/AIDS - Adult Prevalence Rate.</url></fn>. The ELISA test is one of the first and most accurate tests for HIV. For those who carry HIV, the ELISA test is 99.7% accurate. For those who do not carry HIV, the test is 92.6% accurate. If an individual from Swaziland has tested positive, what is the probability that he carries HIV?

    <title>Twins</title><!--  #50 -->
    <statement>
      <p>
        About 30% of human twins are identical, and the rest are fraternal. Identical twins are necessarily the same sex - half are males and the other half are females. One-quarter of fraternal twins are both male, one-quarter both female, and one-half are mixes: one male, one female. You have just become a parent of twins and are told they are both girls. Given this information, what is the probability that they are identical?

        Sally gets a cup of coffee and a muffin every day for breakfast from one of the many coffee shops in her neighborhood. She picks a coffee shop each morning at random and independently of previous days. The average price of a cup of coffee is $1.40 with a standard deviation of 30¢ ($0.30), the average price of a muffin is $2.50 with a standard deviation of 15¢, and the two prices are independent of each other.

    <title>Scooping ice cream</title><!--  #52 -->

      <p>
        Ice cream usually comes in 1.5 quart boxes (48 fluid ounces), and ice cream scoops hold about 2 ounces. However, there is some variability in the amount of ice cream in a box as well as the amount of ice cream scooped out. We represent the amount of ice cream in the box as <m>X</m> and the amount scooped out as <m>Y</m>. Suppose these random variables have the following means, standard deviations, and variances:

              One Saturday morning at 8:55 am there are 27 students outside the gym waiting for it to open.
