      When we have two observations on each person or each case,
      we can answer questions such as the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do students do better on reading or writing sections of standardized tests?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            How do the number of days with temperature above 90<quantity><unit base="degreeFahrenheit"/></quantity> compare between 1948 and 2018?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Are Amazon textbook prices lower than the college bookstore prices?
            If so, how much lower, on average?

      In the previous edition of this textbook,
      we found that Amazon prices were, on average,
      lower than those of the UCLA Bookstore for UCLA courses in 2010.
      It's been several years,
      and many stores have adapted to the online market,
      so we wondered, how is the UCLA Bookstore doing today?
    </p>
    <p>
      We sampled 201 UCLA courses.
      Of those, 68 required books that could be found on Amazon.
      A<nbsp/>portion of the data set from these courses is shown in <xref ref="textbooksDF"></xref>,
      where prices are in U.S. dollars.

      Each textbook has two corresponding prices in the data set:
      one for the UCLA Bookstore and one for Amazon.
      Therefore, each textbook price from the UCLA bookstore has a natural correspondence with a textbook price from Amazon.
      When two sets of observations have this special correspondence,
      they are said to be <term>paired</term>.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Paired data</title>
      <p>
        Two sets of observations are <em>paired</em>
        if each observation in one set has a special correspondence or connection with exactly one observation in the other data set.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      To analyze paired data,
      it is often useful to look at the difference in outcomes of each pair of observations.
      In the <c>textbook</c> data set,
      we look at the differences in prices,
      which is represented as the <c>diff</c> variable.
      Here, for each book, the differences are taken as
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ UCLA Bookstore price }  - \text{ Amazon price }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important that we always subtract using a consistent order;
      here Amazon prices are always subtracted from UCLA prices.
      A histogram of these differences is shown in <xref ref="diffInTextbookPricesF18"></xref>.
      Using differences between paired observations is a common and useful way to analyze paired data.

    <p>
      We will set up and implement a hypothesis test to determine whether,
      on average,
      there is a difference in textbook prices between Amazon and the UCLA bookstore.
      We are considering two scenarios:
      there is no difference in prices or there is some difference in prices.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\mu_{\text{diff}}=0</m>.
            On average, there is no difference in textbook prices.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\mu_{\text{diff}} \neq 0</m>.
            On average, there is some difference in textbook prices.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Can the <m>t</m>-distribution be used for this application?
      The observations are based on a random sample from a large population,
      so independence is reasonable.
      While the distribution of the data is very strongly skewed,
      we do have <m>n = 68</m> observations.
      This sample size is large enough that we do not have to worry about whether the population distribution for difference in price might be nearly normal or not.
      Because the conditions are satisfied,
      we can use the <m>t</m>-distribution to this setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      We compute the standard error associated with
      <m>\bar{x}_{\text{diff}}</m> using the standard deviation of the differences (<m>s_{\text{diff}} = 13.42</m>) and the number of differences (<m>n_{\text{diff}} = 68</m>):
      <md>
        <mrow>SE_{\bar{x}_{\text{diff}}} = \frac{s_{\text{diff}}}{\sqrt{n_{\text{diff}}}} = \frac{13.42}{\sqrt{68}} = 1.63</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we compute the test statistic.
      The point estimate is the observed value of <m>\bar{x}_{\text{diff}}</m>.
      The null value is the value hypothesized under the null hypothesis.
      Here, the null hypothesis is that the true mean of the differences is 0.
      <md>
        <mrow>T = \frac{\text{ point estimate }  - \text{ null value } } {SE \text{ of estimate } } = \frac{3.58- 0}{1.63} = 2.20</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The degrees of freedom are <m>df = 68 - 1 = 67</m>.
      To visualize the p-value,
      the sampling distribution of
      <m>\bar{x}_{\text{diff}}</m> is drawn as though <m>H_0</m> is true.
      This is shown in <xref ref="textbooksF18HTTails"></xref>.
      Because this is a two-sided test,
      the p-value corresponds to the area in both tails.
      Using statistical software, we find the area in the tails to be 0.0312.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the p-value of 0.0312 is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
      We have evidence that, on average,
      there is a difference in textbook prices.
      In particular, we can say that,
      on average, Amazon prices are lower than the UCLA Bookstore prices for UCLA course textbooks.
    </p>

      <caption>Sampling distribution for the mean difference in book prices, if the true average difference is zero.</caption>
      <image width="65%" source="images/inference_means/textbooksF18HTTails.png" />
    </figure>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We have evidence to conclude Amazon is,
          on average, less expensive.
          Does this mean that UCLA students should always buy their books on Amazon?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          No.
          The fact that Amazon is, on average, less expensive,
          does not imply that it is less expensive for
          <em>every</em> textbook.
          Examining the distribution shown in <xref ref="diffInTextbookPricesF18"></xref>,
          we see that there are certainly a handful of cases where Amazon prices are much lower than the UCLA Bookstore's, which suggests it is worth checking Amazon or other online sites before purchasing.
          However, in many cases the Amazon price is <em>above</em>
          what the UCLA Bookstore charges,
          and most of the time the price isn't that different.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      For reference, this is a very different result from what we
      (the authors)
      had seen in a similar data set from 2010.
      At that time, Amazon prices were almost uniformly lower than those of the UCLA Bookstore's and by a large margin,
      making the case to use Amazon over the UCLA Bookstore quite compelling at that time.

          Each of these students took the SAT before and after taking the company's course,

      <p>
        The <m>SE</m> of the sample mean of differences is:

        <p>
          Because we found evidence to support the company's claim,
          does this mean that a student will score more than 100 points higher on the SAT if they take the class than if they do not take the class?
          <fn>No. First, this is an observational study, so we cannot make a causal conclusion. Maybe SAT test takers tend to improve their score over time even if they don't take this SAT class. Secondly, students' scores improved by more than 100 points on average. That does not imply that each student improved by more than 100 points. With a sample standard deviation of 82.2 and a mean of 135.9, some students did worse after the SAT class. This can be verified by <xref ref="satImprovementHTDataHistogram3"></xref></fn>

      We construct a 95% confidence interval for the average price difference between books at the UCLA Bookstore and on Amazon.
      Conditions have already verified, namely,
      that we have paired data from a random sample and that the number of differences is at least 30.
      We must find the critical value, <m>t^{\star}</m>.
      Since <m>df = 67</m> is not on the <m>t</m>-table,
      round the <m>df</m> down to 60 to get a
      <m>t^{\star}</m> of 2.00 for 95% confidence.
      (See <xref ref="matchedpairstint"></xref>
      for how to get a more precise interval using a calculator.)
      Plugging the <m>t^{\star}</m> value, point estimate,
      and standard error into the confidence interval formula,
      we<nbsp/>get:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ point estimate }  \ \amp \pm\ t^{\star}\times SE\ \text{ of estimate } \to 3.58 \ <!-- \amp --> \pm\ 2.00 \times \frac{13.42}{\sqrt{68}} \to (0.33, 6.83)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We are 95% confident that the UCLA bookstore is, on average,
      between $0.33 and $6.83 more expensive than Amazon for UCLA course books.
      This interval does not contain zero,
      so it is consistent with the earlier hypothesis test that <em>rejected</em>
      the null hypothesis that the average difference was 0.
      Because our interval is entirely above 0, we have evidence that the true average difference is greater than zero.
      Unlike the hypothesis test,
      the confidence interval gives us a good idea of how much more expensive the UCLA bookstore might be,
      on average.

        Here, <m>{\text{diff}}</m> = <m>{\text{ SAT score after course } - \text{ SAT score before course } }</m>.
        We will estimate this parameter at the 95% confidence level.

      <p>
        <alert>Choose</alert>: Because we have paired data and the parameter to be estimated is a mean of differences,
        we will use a 1-sample <m>t</m>-interval with paired data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <alert>Check</alert>: We have a random sample of students with paired observations on them. We will assume that these 30 students represent less than 10% of the total number of such students. Finally, the number of differences is <m>n_{\text{diff}}=30\ge 30</m>, so we can proceed with the 1-sample <m>t</m>-interval.

        </md>
      </p>

        The point estimate is the sample mean of differences:
        <m>\bar{x}_{\text{diff}} = 135.9</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <m>SE</m> of the sample mean of differences is:
        <m>\frac{s_{\text{diff}}}{\sqrt{n_{\text{diff}}}} = \frac{82.2}{\sqrt{30}}=15.0</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        We find <m>t^{\star}</m> for the one sample case using the <m>t</m>-table at row
        <m>df = n -1</m> and confidence level C%. For a 95% confidence level and
        <m>df = 30 - 1 = 29</m>, <m>t^{\star} = 2.045</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 95% confidence interval is given by:
        <md>
          <mrow>135.9 \ \pm\  \amp 2.045\times  \frac{82.2}{\sqrt{30}}  \qquad df = 15</mrow>

      </p>
      <p>
        <alert>Conclude</alert>: We are 95% confident that the true <em>average</em>
        increase in SAT score following the company's course is between 105.2 points to 166.6 points.
        There is sufficient evidence that students score greater than 100 points higher,
        on average,
        after the company's course because the entire interval is above 100.

          Based on the interval (105.2, 166.6), calculated previously,
          can we say that 95% of student scores increased between 105.2 and 166.6 points after taking the company's course?
          <fn>No. This interval is attempting to capture the average increase. It is not attempting to capture 95% of the increases. Looking at <xref ref="satImprovementHTDataHistogramrepeat"></xref>, we see that only a small percent had increases between 105.2 and 166.6.</fn>

          In our UCLA textbook example,
          we had 68 paired differences.
          Because <m>df=67</m> was not on our <m>t</m>-table,
          we rounded the <m>df</m> down to 60.
          This gave us a 95% confidence interval (0.325, 6.834).
          Use a calculator to find the more exact 95% confidence interval based on 67 degrees of freedom.
          How different is it from the one we calculated based on 60 degrees of freedom?
          <fn>Choose <c>TInterval</c> or equivalent. We do not have all the data, so choose <c>Stats</c> on a TI or <c>Var</c> on a Casio. Enter <c>x</c> <m>= 3.58</m> and <c>Sx</c> <m>= 13.42</m>. Let <c>n</c> <m>= 68</m> and <c>C-Level</c> <m>= 0.95</m>. This should give the interval (0.332, 6.828). The intervals are equivalent when rounded to two decimal places.</fn>

    <title>Section summary</title>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Paired data can come from a random sample or a matched pairs experiment. With paired data,
          we are often interested in whether the <em>difference</em>
          is positive, negative, or zero.
          For example,
          the difference of paired data from a matched pairs experiment tells us whether one treatment did better, worse,
          or the same as the other treatment for each subject.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We use the notation <m>\bar{x}_{\text{diff}}</m> to represent the mean of the sample differences.
          Likewise, <m>s_{\text{diff}}</m> is the standard deviation of the sample differences,
          and <m>n_{\text{diff}}</m> is the number of sample differences.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To carry out inference on paired data,
          we first find all of the sample differences.
          Then, we perform a one-sample procedure using the <em>differences</em>.
          For this reason,
          the confidence interval and hypothesis test with paired data use the same one-sample <m>t</m>-procedures,
          where the degrees of freedom is given by <m>n_{\text{diff}}-1</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When there is paired data and the parameter of interest is a mean of the differences:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Estimate <m>\mu_{\text{diff}}</m> at the C% confidence level using a
                <term>1-sample <m>t</m>-interval</term> with paired data.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Test <m>H_0</m>:
                <m>\mu_{\text{diff}}=0</m> at the <m>\alpha</m> significance level using a
                <term>1-sample <m>t</m>-test</term> with paired data.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The one-sample <m>t</m>-interval and and <m>t</m>-test  with paired data require the sampling distribution for <m>\bar{x}_{diff}</m> to be nearly normal. For this reason, we must check that the following conditions are met.
          <ol marker="1.">
            <li>
              <p>
                Independence: Data should come from one random sample (with paired observations) or from a randomized matched pairs experiment. If sampling without replacement, check that the sample size is less than 10% of the population size.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Large sample or normal population: <m>n_{\text{diff}}\ge 30</m> or population of differences nearly normal. If the number of differences is less than 30 and it is not known that the population of differences is nearly normal, we argue that the population of differences could be nearly normal if there is no strong skew or outliers in the sample differences.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When the conditions are met,
          we calculate the confidence interval and the test statistic as we did in the previous section.
          Here, our data is a list of differences.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Confidence interval: <m>\text{ point estimate } \ \pm\ t^{\star} \times SE\ \text{ of estimate }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Test statistic:
                <m>T = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value} }{SE \text{ of estimate } }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here the point estimate is the mean of sample differences:
        <m>\bar{x}_{\text{diff}}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <m>SE</m> of estimate is the <m>SE</m> of a mean of sample differences:
          <m>\frac{s_{\textit{diff}}}{\sqrt{n_{\text{diff}}}}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The degrees of freedom is given by <m>df = n_{\textit{diff}}-1</m>.

        Let's consider a limited set of climate data,
        examining temperature differences in 1948 vs 2018.
        We randomly sampled 197 locations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) historical data,
        where the data was available for both years of interest.
        We want to know:
        were there more days with temperatures exceeding 90<quantity><unit base="degreeFahrenheit"/></quantity> in 2018 or 1948?<fn>NOAA, <url href="www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets">www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets</url>, April 24, 2019.</fn> The difference in number of days exceeding 90<quantity><unit base="degreeFahrenheit"/></quantity>
        (number of days in 2018 - number of days in 1948)
        was calculated for each of the 197 locations.
        The average of these differences was 2.9 days with a standard deviation of 17.2 days.
        We are interested in determining whether these data provide strong evidence that there were more days in 2018 that exceeded 90<quantity><unit base="degreeFahrenheit"/></quantity> from NOAA's weather stations.

              Locations were randomly sampled, so independence is reasonable. The sample size is at least 30, so we're just looking for particularly extreme outliers: none are present (the observation off left in the histogram would be considered a clear outlier, but not a particularly extreme one). Therefore, the conditions are satisfied.
