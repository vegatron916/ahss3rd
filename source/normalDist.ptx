      What proportion of adults have systolic blood pressure above 140?
      What is the probability of getting more than 250 heads in 400 tosses of a fair coin?
      If the average weight of a piece of carry-on luggage is 11 pounds,
      what is the probability that 200 random carry on pieces will weigh more than 2500 pounds?
      If 55% of a population supports a certain candidate,
      what is the probability that she will have less than 50% support in a random sample of size 200?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one distribution that can help us answer all of these questions.
      Can you guess what it is?
      That's right <mdash/> it's the normal distribution.

    <title>Normal distribution model</title>
    <p>
      Among all the distributions we see in practice,
      one is overwhelmingly the most common.
      The symmetric,
      unimodal, bell curve is ubiquitous throughout statistics.
      Indeed it is so common,
      that people often know it as the <term>normal curve</term>
      or <term>normal distribution</term>.
          <idx><h>distribution</h><h>normal</h></idx>
      <fn>
      It is also introduced as the Gaussian distribution after Frederic Gauss,
      the first person to formalize its mathematical expression.
      </fn> A normal curve is shown in <xref ref="simpleNormal"></xref>.

    </figure>
    <p>
      The <term>normal distribution</term>
      always describes a symmetric,
      unimodal, bell-shaped curve.
      However, these curves can look different depending on the details of the model.
      Specifically,
      the normal distribution model can be adjusted using two parameters:
      mean and standard deviation.
      As you can probably guess,
      changing the mean shifts the bell curve to the left or right,
      while changing the standard deviation stretches or constricts the curve.
      <xref ref="twoSampleNormals"></xref>
      shows the normal distribution with mean <m>0</m> and standard deviation <m>1</m> in the left panel and the normal distributions with mean <m>19</m> and standard deviation <m>4</m> in the right panel.
      <xref ref="twoSampleNormalsStacked"></xref>
      shows these distributions on the same axis.

    <p>
      Because the mean and standard deviation describe a normal distribution exactly,
      they are called the distribution's <term>parameters</term>.

      The normal distribution with mean <m>\mu=0</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma = 1</m> is called the

      <title>Normal distribution facts</title>
      <p>
        Many variables are nearly normal,
        but none are exactly normal.
        The normal distribution, while never perfect,
        provides very close approximations for a variety of scenarios.
        We will use it to model data as well as probability distributions.

  <subsection>
    <title>Using the normal distribution to approximate empirical distributions</title>
    <p>
      We often want to put data onto a standardized scale,
      which can make comparisons more reasonable.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="actSAT">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <xref ref="satACTstats"></xref> shows the mean and standard deviation for total scores on the SAT and ACT. The distribution of SAT and ACT scores are both nearly normal. Suppose Ann scored 1300 on her SAT and Tom scored 24 on his ACT. Who performed better?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          As we saw in <xref ref="z_scores"></xref>, we can use Z-scores to compare observations from diferent distributions. Using Ann's SAT score, 1300, along with the SAT mean and SD, we can find Ann's Z-scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>Z_{\text{Ann}} = \frac{x_{\text{Ann}}-\mu_{\text{SAT}}}{\sigma_{\text{SAT}}} = \frac{1300-1100}{200} = 1</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, using Tom's ACT score, 24, along with the ACT mean and SD we can find his Z-scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>Z_{\text{Tom}} = \frac{x_{\text{Tom}}-\mu_{\text{ACT}}}{\sigma_{\text{ACT}}} = \frac{24-21}{6} = 0.5</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because Ann's score was 1 standard deviation above the mean, while Tom's score was 0.5 standard deviations above the mean, we can say that Ann did better than Tom.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

      Assuming that both the that both the SAT and ACT distributions are nearly normally distributed, what percent of test takers scored lower than Ann? What percent scored lower than Tom? To answer these question exactly, we would need all of the data. However, if we use the information that SAT and ACT distributions are nearly normal, we can estimate these percents. <xref ref="satActNormals"></xref> shows these distributions modeled with a normal curve. If we can find the percent of the normal curve that is to the left of Ann’s score, we could use that percent as our estimate of the percent of the data points that are smaller than Ann’s score. We call this process <em>normal approximation</em>. The steps are:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol marker="1.">
        <li>
          <p>
            First verify that the distribution can be reasonably modeled with a normal distribution.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Convert value or values of interest to Z-scores.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Find the relevant area/percent under the standard normal curve.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      We use the area/percent that we find from the normal curve as our <em>estimate</em> of the desired percent.

  <title>Finding areas under the normal curve</title>
    <p>
      It’s very useful in statistics to be able to identify areas of distributions, especially tail areas. For instance, what percent of people have an SAT score below Ann’s score of 1300? This is the same as Ann’s <term>percentile</term>. We previously determined that a score of 1300 corresponds to a Z-score of 1 and that SAT scores are approximately normally distributed. We can visualize such a tail area by sketching a normal curve and shading everything below <m>Z = 1</m> as shown in <xref ref="satACTstats"></xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="BelowOneZ">
      <caption>The area to the left of the Z-score represents the percentile of the observation</caption>
      <image width="60%" source="images/summarizing/BelowOneZ.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      There are many techniques for finding this area, and we’ll discuss three of the options.
      <ol marker="1.">
        <li>
          <p>
            The most common approach in practice is to use statistical software. For example, in the program R, we could find the area shown in <xref ref="BelowOneZ"></xref> using the following command, which takes in the Z-score of 1 and returns the lower tail area:
            <pre>
            > pnorm(1)
            [1] 0.8413447
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the online Desmos calculator, we could do: <c>normaldist( )</c>, check the <q>Find Cumulative Probability (CDF)</q> box and set Max to 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to these calculation, the area shaded that is below <m>Z = 1</m> is 0.841, so we estimate that 84.1% of SAT test takers score below 1300 and that Ann is at the 84th percentile. There are many other software options, such as Pythn or SAS; even spreadsheet programs such as Excel and Google Sheets support these calculations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A common strategy in classrooms is to use a graphing calculator, such as a TI or Casio calculator. Instructions for finding areas of a normal distribution using these calculators are provided in <xref ref="tech_normal"></xref>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The last option for finding tail areas is to use what’s called a probability table; these are occasionally used in classrooms but rarely in practice. <xref ref="z_table"></xref> contains such a table and a guide for how to use it.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will solve normal distribution problems in this section by always first finding the Z-score. The reason is that we will encounter close parallels called test statistics beginning in <xref ref="foundationsForInference"></xref>; these are, in many instances, an equivalent of a Z-score.
    </p>
    <p>
      Readers may find it helpful to familiarize themselves with one of the options above before continuing on to the applications that follow.

    <title>Normal probability examples</title>
    <p>
      Combined SAT scores are approximated well by a normal model with mean 1100 and standard deviation 200.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="satAbove1190Exam">
      <statement>
        <p>
          What is the probability that a randomly selected SAT taker scores at least 1190 on the SAT?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The probability that a randomly selected SAT taker scores at least 1190 on the SAT is equivalent to the proportion of all SAT takers that score at least 1190 on the SAT. First, always draw and label a picture of the normal distribution. (Drawings need not be exact to be useful.) We are interested in the probability that a randomly selected score will be above 1190, so we shade this upper tail:
        </p>
        <image width="65%" source="images/distributions/satAbove1190.png" />
        <p>
          The picture shows the mean and the values at 2 standard deviations above and below the mean. The simplest way to find the shaded area under the curve makes use of the Z-score of the cutoff value. With <m>\mu=1100</m>, <m>\sigma=200</m>, and the cutoff value <m>x=1190</m>, the Z-score is computed as
          <md>
            <mrow>Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{1190 - 1100}{200} = \frac{90}{200} = 0.45</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we want to find the area under the normal curve to the right of <m>Z=0.45</m>. Using technology, we find <m>P(Z>0.45)=0.3264</m>. The probability that a randomly selected score is at least 1190 on the SAT is 0.3264.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <assemblage>
    <title>Always draw a picture first, and find the Z-score second</title>
      <p>
        For any normal probability situation, <em>always always always</em> draw and label the normal curve and shade the area of interest first. The picture will provide an estimate of the probability.
      </p>
      <p>
        After drawing a figure to represent the situation, identify the Z-score for the observation of interest.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Edward earned a 1030 on his SAT. What is his percentile?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First, a picture is needed. Edward's percentile is the proportion of people who do not get as high as a 1030. These are the scores to the left of 1030.
        </p>
        <image width="65%" source="images/distributions/satBelow1030.png" />
        <p>
          Identifying the mean <m>\mu=1100</m>, the standard deviation <m>\sigma=200</m>, and the cutoff for the tail area <m>x=1030</m> makes it easy to compute the Z-score:
          <md>
            <mrow>Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{1030 - 1100}{200} = -0.35</mrow>

        </p>
        <p>
          Using technology we find that <m>P(Z \lt -0.35)=0.3632</m>. Edward is at the <m>36^{th}</m> percentile.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          If Edward did better than 36% of SAT takers, then about 64% must have done better than him.

      The last several problems have focused on finding the probability or percentile for a particular observation.
      It is also possible to identify the value corresponding to a particular percentile.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Carlos believes he can get into his preferred college if he scores at least in the 80th percentile on the SAT. What score should he aim for?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Here, we are given a percentile rather than a Z-score,
          so we work backwards.
          As always, first draw the picture.

        <image width="65%" source="images/distributions/sat80thPercentile.png" />
        <p>
          We want to find the observation that corresponds to the 80th percentile. First, we find the Z-score associated with the 80th percentile. Using technology, we find that <m>P(Z \lt 0.84)=0.80</m>. In any normal distribution, a value with a Z-score of 0.84 will be at the 80th percentile. Once we have the Z-score, we work backwards to find <m>x</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>Z \amp = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}</mrow>

    <assemblage>
      <title>If the data are not nearly normal, don't use the normal approximation</title>
      <p>
        Before using the normal approximation method, verify that the data or distribution is approximately normal. If it is not, the normal approximation will give incorrect results. Also remember that all answers based on normal approximations are in fact approximations and are not exact.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      Finally, we should observe that it is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4, 5, or even more standard deviations from the mean. The probability of being further than 4 standard deviations from the mean is about 1-in-15,000. For 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-2 million and 1-in-500 million, respectively. However, while the tails of the normal distribution extend infinitely in either direction, our data sets are finite and normal approximation in the extreme tails is unlikely to be very accurate, even for bell-shaped data sets.

    <title>68-95-99.7 rule</title>
      <p>
        Here, we present a useful rule of thumb for the probability of falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution. The 68-96-99.7 rules, also known as the <em>empirical rule</em>, will be useful in a wide range of practical settings, especially when trying to make a quick estimate without a calculator or Z-table.

      <exercise>
        <statement>
        <p>
          Use the Z-table to confirm that about 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of observations fall within 1, 2, and 3, standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution, respectively. For instance, first find the area that falls between <m>Z = −1</m> and <m>Z = 1</m>, which should have an area of about 0.68. Similarly there should be an area of about 0.95 between <m>Z = −2</m> and <m>Z = 2</m>.
          <fn>First draw the pictures. To find the area between <m>Z = −1</m> and <m>Z = 1</m>, use the normal probability table todetermine the areas below <m>Z = −1</m> and above <m>Z = 1</m>. Next verify the area between <m>Z = −1</m> and <m>Z = 1</m> is about 0.68. Repeat this for <m>Z = −2</m> to <m>Z = 2</m> and also for <m>Z = −3</m> to <m>Z = 3</m>.

      <p>
        It is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4, 5, or even more standard deviations from the mean. However, these occurrences are very rare if the data are nearly normal. The probability of being further than 4 standard deviations from the mean is about 1-in-15,000. For 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-2 million and 1-in-500 million, respectively.

          To find an area under the normal curve using a calculator,
          first identify a lower bound and an upper bound.
          Theoretically,
          we want all of the area to the left of 1.5, so the left endpoint should be -<m>\infty</m>.
          However, the area under the curve is nearly negligible when <m>Z</m> is smaller than -4, so we will use -5 as the lower bound when not given a lower bound
          (any other negative number smaller than -5 will also work).
          Using a lower bound of -5 and an upper bound of 1.5, we get <m>P(Z \lt 1.5) = 0.933</m>.

          Therefore our lower bound will be 2 and the upper bound will be +5

      Here, we present a useful rule of thumb for the probability of falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution.
      This will be useful in a wide range of practical settings,

          respectively.
          For instance,
          first find the area that falls between <m>Z=-1</m> and <m>Z=1</m>,
          which should have an area of about 0.68.

          To find the area between <m>Z=-1</m> and <m>Z=1</m>,
          use the normal probability table to determine the areas below <m>Z=-1</m> and above <m>Z=1</m>.
          Next verify the area between <m>Z=-1</m> and <m>Z=1</m> is about 0.68.

      It is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4, 5, or even more standard deviations from the mean. However, these occurrences are very rare if the data are nearly normal. The probability of being further than 4 standard deviations from the mean is about 1-in-15,000. For 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-2 million and 1-in-500 million, respectively.

    <title>Evaluating the normal approximation (special topic)</title>
    <p>
      It is important to remember normality is always an approximation.
      Testing the appropriateness of the normal assumption is a key step in many data analyses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distribution of heights of US males is well approximated by the normal model.
      We are interested in proceeding under the assumption that the data are normally distributed,
      but first we must check to see if this is reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two visual methods for checking the assumption of normality that can be implemented and interpreted quickly.
      The first is a simple histogram with the best fitting normal curve overlaid on the plot,
      as shown in the left panel of <xref ref="fcidMHeights"></xref>.
      The sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> and standard deviation <m>s</m> are used as the parameters of the best fitting normal curve.
      The closer this curve fits the histogram,
      the more reasonable the normal model assumption.
      Another more common method is examining a
      <term>normal probability plot</term>,<fn>
      Also commonly called a <term>quantile-quantile plot</term>.
      </fn> shown in the right panel of <xref ref="fcidMHeights"></xref>.
      The closer the points are to a perfect straight line,
      the more confident we can be that the data follow the normal model.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fcidMHeights">
      <caption>A sample of 100 male heights. The observations are rounded to the nearest whole inch, explaining why the points appear to jump in increments in the normal probability plot.</caption>

    </figure>
 <!--    <p>
      Three data sets of 40, 100,
      and 400 samples were simulated from a normal distribution,
      and the histograms and normal probability plots of the data sets are shown in <xref ref="normalExamples"></xref>.
      These will provide a benchmark for what to look for in plots of real data.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="normalExamples">
      <caption>Histograms and normal probability plots for three simulated normal data sets; <m>n=40</m> (left), <m>n=100</m> (middle), <m>n=400</m> (right).</caption>
      <image width="85%" source="images/distributions/normalExamples.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      The left panels show the histogram (top) and normal probability plot (bottom) for the simulated data set with 40 observations.
      The data set is too small to really see clear structure in the histogram.
      The normal probability plot also reflects this,
      where there are some deviations from the line.
      However, these deviations are not strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The middle panels show diagnostic plots for the data set with 100 simulated observations.
      The histogram shows more normality and the normal probability plot shows a better fit.
      While there is one observation that deviates noticeably from the line,
      it is not particularly extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data set with 400 observations has a histogram that greatly resembles the normal distribution,
      while the normal probability plot is nearly a perfect straight line.
      Again in the normal probability plot there is one observation
      (the largest)
      that deviates slightly from the line.
      If that observation had deviated 3 times further from the line,
      it would be of much greater concern in a real data set.
      Apparent outliers can occur in normally distributed data but they are rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice the histograms look more normal as the sample size increases,
      and the normal probability plot becomes straighter and more stable.

          The top-left plot shows some deviations in the smallest values in the data set;

The area under the normal curve between -1.5 and 1.5 <m>= P(−1.5 \lt Z \lt 1.5) = 0.866</m>. Note that is not simply the average of 0.6827 and 0.9545, as the normal curve is not a rectangle.</fn>

      <statement>
      <p>
        Use a calculator to determine what percentile corresponds to a Z-score of 1.5 for a normal distribution.<fn>normalcdf gives the result without drawing the graph. To draw the graph, do 2nd VARS, DRAW, 1:ShadeNorm. However, beware of errors caused by other plots that might interfere with this plot.</fn>

        <p>
          To find an area under the normal curve using a calculator, first identify a lower bound and an upper bound. We want all of the area to the left of 1.5, so the lower bound should be <m>-\infty</m>. However, the area under the curve is negligible when Z is smaller than -5, so we will use -5 as the lower bound. Using a lower bound of -5 and an upper bound of 1.5, we get <m>P(Z \lt 1.5) = 0.933</m>.

          A <term>Z-score</term> represents the number of standard deviations a value in a data set is above or below the mean. To calculate a <m>Z</m>-score use:
          <m>Z = \frac{x-\text{ mean } }{SD}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>normal distribution</term> is the most commonly used distribution in Statistics. Many distribution are approximately normal, but none are exactly normal.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The empirical rule (68-95-99.7 Rule) comes from the normal distribution. The closer a distribution is to normal, the better this rule will hold.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It is often useful to use the standard normal distribution, which has mean 0 and SD 1, to approximate a discrete histogram. There are two common types of <term>normal approximation problems</term>, and for each a key step is to find a <m>Z</m>-score.

    <title>Triathlon times, Part I</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In triathlons,
        it is common for racers to be placed into age and gender groups.
        Friends Leo and Mary both completed the Hermosa Beach Triathlon,
        where Leo competed in the <em>Men, Ages 30 - 34</em>
        group while Mary competed in the
        <em>Women, Ages 25 - 29</em> group.
        Leo completed the race in 1:22:28 (4948 seconds),
        while Mary completed the race in 1:31:53 (5513 seconds).
        Obviously Leo finished faster,
        but they are curious about how they did within their respective groups.
        Can you help them?
        Here is some information on the performance of their groups:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The finishing times of the <em>Men, Ages 30 - 34</em>
              group has a mean of 4313 seconds with a standard deviation of 583 seconds.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The finishing times of the <em>Women, Ages 25 - 29</em>
              group has a mean of 5261 seconds with a standard deviation of 807 seconds.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The distributions of finishing times for both groups are approximately Normal.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember: a better performance corresponds to a faster finish.
        <ol>
