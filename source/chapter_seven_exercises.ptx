  <title>Gaming and distracted eating, Part I</title><!--  #33 -->
    <statement>
      <p>
        A group of researchers are interested in the possible effects of distracting stimuli during eating, such as an increase or decrease in the amount of food consumption. To test this hypothesis, they monitored food intake for a group of 44 patients who were randomized into two equal groups. The treatment group ate lunch while playing solitaire, and the control group ate lunch without any added distractions. Patients in the treatment group ate 52.1 grams of biscuits, with a standard deviation of 45.1 grams, and patients in the control group ate 27.1 grams of biscuits, with a standard deviation of 26.4 grams. Do these data provide convincing evidence that the average food intake (measured in amount of biscuits consumed) is different for the patients in the treatment group? Assume that conditions for inference are satisfied.<fn>R.E.

  <title>Gaming and distracted eating, Part II</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The researchers from <xref ref="gaming_and_distracted_eating_exercise"></xref> also investigated the effects of being distracted by a game on how much people eat. The 22 patients in the treatment group who ate their lunch while playing solitaire were asked to do a serial-order recall of the food lunch items they ate. The average number of items recalled by the patients in this group was 4. 9, with a standard deviation of 1.8. The average number of items recalled by the patients in the control group (no distraction) was 6.1, with a standard deviation of 1.8. Do these data provide strong evidence that the average number of food items recalled by the patients in the treatment and control groups are different?

  <title>Sample size and pairing</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Determine if the following statement is true or false, and if false, explain your reasoning: If comparing means of two groups with equal sample sizes, always use a paired test.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        False. While it is true that paired analysis requires equal sample sizes, only having the equal sample sizes isn't, on its own, sufficient for doing a paired test. Paired tests require that there be a special correspondence between each pair of observations in the two groups.

  <title>Hen eggs</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
      	The distribution of the number of eggs laid by a certain species of hen during their breeding period has a mean of 35 eggs with a standard deviation of 18.2. Suppose a group of researchers randomly samples 45 hens of this species, counts the number of eggs laid during their breeding period, and records the sample mean. They repeat this 1,000 times, and build a distribution of sample means.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              What is this distribution called?

              Would you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed? Explain your reasoning.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            	Suppose the researchers' budget is reduced and they are only able to collect random samples of 10 hens. The sample mean of the number of eggs is recorded, and we repeat this 1,000 times, and build a new distribution of sample means. How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the original distribution?

            <p>
              We are building a distribution of sample statistics, in this case the sample mean. Such a distribution is called a sampling distribution.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Because we are dealing with the distribution of sample means, we need to check to see if the Central Limit Theorem applies. Our sample size is greater than 30, and we are told that random sampling is employed. With these conditions met, we expect that the distribution of the sample mean will be nearly normal and therefore symmetric.

          <li>
            <p>
              Because we are dealing with a sampling distribution, we measure its variability with the standard error. <m>SE = 18.2/ \sqrt{45} = 2.713</m>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The sample means will be more variable with the smaller sample size.

  <title>Exclusive relationships</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
      	A survey conducted on a reasonably random sample of 203 undergraduates asked, among many other questions, about the number of exclusive relationships these students have been in. The histogram below shows the distribution of the data from this sample. The sample average is 3.2 with a standard deviation of 1.97.

	      Estimate the average number of exclusive relationships Duke students have been in using a 90% confidence interval and interpret this interval in context. Check any conditions required for inference, and note any assumptions you must make as you proceed with your calculations and conclusions.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Independence: it is a random sample, so we can assume that the students in this sample are independent of each other with respect to number of exclusive relationships they have been in. Notice that there are no students who have had no exclu-sive relationships in the sample, which suggests some student responses are likely missing (perhaps only positive values were reported). The sample size is at least 30, and there are no particularly extreme outliers, so the normality condition is reasonable. 90% CI: <m>(2.97, 3.43)</m>. We are 90% confident that undergraduate students have been in 2.97 to 3.43 exclusive relationships, on average.

  <title>Online communication</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A study suggests that the average college student spends 10 hours per week communicating with others online. You believe that this is an underestimate and decide to collect your own sample for a hypothesis test. You randomly sample 60 students from your dorm and find that on average they spent 13.5 hours a week communicating with others online. A friend of yours, who offers to help you with the hypothesis test, comes up with the following set of hypotheses. Indicate any errors you see.

        First, the hypotheses should be about the population mean (<m>\mu</m>), not the sample mean. Second, the null hypothesis should have an equal sign and the alternative hypothesis should be about the null hypothesized value, not the observed sample mean. The correct way to set up these hypotheses is shown below:

              Independence: The months selected are not random. However, if we think these dates are roughly equivalent to a simple random sample of all such Friday 6th/13th date pairs, then independence is reasonable. To proceed, we must make this strong assumption, though we should note this assumption in any reported results. Normality: With fewer than 10 observations, we would need to see clear outliers to be concerned. There is a borderline outlier on the right of the histogram of the differences, so we would want to report this in formal analysis results.

The data provide strong evidence that the average number of cars at the intersection is higher on Friday the <m>6^{th}</m> than on Friday the <m>13^{th}</m>. (We should exercise caution about generalizing the interpretation to all intersections or roads.)

              If the average number of cars passing the intersection actually was the same on Friday the <m>6^{th}</m> and <m>13^{th}</m>, then the probability that we would observe a test statistic so far from zero is less than 0.01.

      <p>
        The Friday the 13<m>^{th}</m> study reported in <xref ref="friday_13th_traffic"></xref>
        also provides data on traffic accident related emergency room admissions.
        The distributions of these counts from Friday the 6<m>^{th}</m> and Friday the 13<m>^{th}</m> are shown below for six such paired dates along with summary statistics.
        You may assume that conditions for inference are met.

            The conclusion of the original study states,
            <q>Friday 13th is unlucky for some.
            The risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52%. Staying at home is recommended.</q>

The data provide strong evidence that the average number of traffic accident related emergency room admissions are different between Friday the <m>6^{th}</m> and Friday the <m>13^{th}</m>. Furthermore, the data indicate that the direction of that difference is that accidents are lower on Friday the <m>6^{th}</m> relative to Friday the <m>13^{th}</m>.

              This is an oservational study, not an experiment, so we cannot so easily infer a causal intervention implied by this statement. It is true that there is a difference. However, for example, this does not mean that a responsible adult going out on Friday the <m>13^{th}</m> has a higher chance of harm than on any other night.
