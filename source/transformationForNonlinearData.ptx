  <title>Transformations for skewed data</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      County population size among the counties in the US is very strongly right skewed.
      Can we apply a transformation to make the distribution more symmetric?
      How would such a transformation affect the scatterplot and residual plot when another variable is graphed against this variable?
      In this section,
      we will see the power of transformations for very skewed data.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the histogram of county populations shown in <xref ref="county_pop_transformed_i"></xref>,
          which shows extreme skew.
              <idx><h>skew</h><h>example: extreme</h></idx>
          What isn't useful about this plot?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Nearly all of the data fall into the left-most bin,
          and the extreme skew obscures many of the potentially interesting details in the data.
        </p>
      </solution>

      (b) A histogram of log<m>_{10}</m>-transformed county populations.
      For this plot, the x-value corresponds to the power of 10,
      e.g. <q>4</q> on the x-axis corresponds to <m>10^4 =</m> 10,000.</caption>

    <p>
      There are some standard transformations that may be useful for strongly right skewed data where much of the data is positive but clustered near zero.
      A <term>transformation</term> is a rescaling of the data using a function.
      For instance,
      a plot of the logarithm (base 10) of county populations results in the new histogram in <xref ref="county_pop_transformed_log"></xref>.
      This data is symmetric,
      and any potential outliers appear much less extreme than in the original data set.
      By reigning in the outliers and extreme skew,
      transformations like this often make it easier to build statistical models against the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transformations can also be applied to one or both variables in a scatterplot.
      A scatterplot of the population change from 2010 to 2017 against the population in 2010 is shown in <xref ref="county_pop_change_v_pop_transform_i"></xref>.
      In this first scatterplot,
      it's hard to decipher any interesting patterns because the population variable is so strongly skewed.
      However, if we apply a log<m>_{10}</m> transformation to the population variable,
      as shown in <xref ref="county_pop_change_v_pop_transform_log"></xref>,
      a positive association between the variables is revealed.
      While fitting a line to predict population change (2010 to 2017) from population (in 2010) does not seem reasonable,
      fitting a line to predict population from log<m>_{10}</m>(population) does seem reasonable.

    <p>
      Transformations other than the logarithm can be useful, too.
      For instance,
      the square root (<m>\sqrt{\text{ original observation } }</m>) and inverse (<m>\frac{1}{\text{ original observation } }</m>) are commonly used by data scientists.
      Common goals in transforming data are to see the data structure differently,
      reduce skew, assist in modeling,
      or straighten a nonlinear relationship in a scatterplot.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the scatterplot and residual plot in <xref ref="pretransform"></xref>.
          The regression output is also provided.
          Is the linear model <m>\hat{y} = -52.3564 + 2.7842 x</m> a good model for the data?
        </p>
        <pre>
           The regression equation is

           y = -52.3564 + 2.7842 x

           Predictor       Coef   SE Coef         T          P
           Constant    -52.3564    7.2757    -7.196      3e-08
           x             2.7842    0.1768    15.752    &lt; 2e-16

           S = 13.76    R-Sq = 88.26%    R-Sq(adj) = 87.91%
        </pre>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can note the <m>R^2</m> value is fairly large.
          However, this alone does not mean that the model is good.
          Another model might be much better.
          When assessing the appropriateness of a linear model,
          we should look at the residual plot.
          The <m>\cup</m>-pattern in the residual plot tells us the original data is curved.
          If we inspect the two plots,
          we can see that for small and large values of <m>x</m> we systematically underestimate <m>y</m>,
          whereas for middle values of <m>x</m>,
          we systematically overestimate <m>y</m>.
          The curved trend can also be seen in the original scatterplot.
          Because of this, the linear model is not appropriate,
          and it would not be appropriate to perform a <m>t</m>-test for the slope because the conditions for inference are not met.
          However, we might be able to use a transformation to linearize the data.
        </p>
      </solution>

      Regression analysis is easier to perform on linear data.
      When data are nonlinear,
      we sometimes <term>transform</term>
      the data in a way that makes the resulting relationship linear.
      The most common <term>transformation</term>
      is log of the <m>y</m> values.
      Sometimes we also apply a transformation to the <m>x</m> values.
      We generally use the residuals as a way to evaluate whether the transformed data are more linear.
      If so, we can say that a better model has been found.

          Using the regression output for the transformed data,
          write the new linear regression equation.

        <pre>
           The regression equation is

           log(y) = 1.722540 + 0.052985 x
