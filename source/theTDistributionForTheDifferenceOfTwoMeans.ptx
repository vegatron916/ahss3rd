        <li>
          <p>
            Is there statistically significant evidence that one variation of an exam is harder than another variation?

    <title>Sampling distribution for the difference of two means</title>
    <p>
      In this section we are interested in comparing the means of two independent groups. We want to estimate how far apart <m>\mu_{1}</m> and <m>\mu_{2}</m> are and test whether their difference is zero or not. Before we perform inference for the difference of means, letâ€™s review the sampling distribution for <m>\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}</m>, which will be used as the point estimate for <m>\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}</m>. We know from <xref ref="samp_dist_difference"></xref> that when the independence condition is satisfied, the sampling distribution for <m>\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}</m> is centered on <m>\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}</m> and has standard deviation of
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \sigma_{\bar{x}_{1} -\bar{x}_{2}} =\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{n_{2}}}
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the individual population standard deviations are unknown, we estimate the standard deviation of <m>\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}</m> using the Standard Error, abbreviated <em>SE</em>, by plugging in the sample standard deviations as our best guesses of the population standard deviations:
      <md>
        <mrow>
          SE_{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{s_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{s_{2}^2}{n_{2}}}
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference of two sample means <m>\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}</m> follows a nearly normal distribution when certain conditions are met. First, the sampling distribution for each sample mean must be nearly normal, and second, the observations must be independent, both within and between groups. Under these two conditions, the sampling distribution for <m>\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}</m> may be well approximated using the normal model.
    </p>
  </subsection>
<!--     Previously we explored the sampling distribution for the difference of two proportions.
      Here we consider the sampling distribution for the difference of two means.
      We are interested in the distribution of <m>\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2</m>.
      We know that it is centered on <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m>.
      The standard deviation for the difference can be found as follows.
      <md>
        <mrow>SD_{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}} \amp = \sqrt{\left(SD_{\bar{x}_{1}}\right)^2 +\left(SD_{\bar{x}_{2}}\right)^2 }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_{1}}{\sqrt{n_1}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sigma_{2}}{\sqrt{n_2}}\right)^2 }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{n_{2}}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we are interested in the shape of the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2</m>.
      It will be nearly normal when the sampling distribution of each of
      <m>\bar{x}_1</m> and <m>\bar{x}_2</m> are nearly normal.

    <title>Checking conditions for inference on a difference of means</title>
    <p>
      When comparing two means,
      we carry out inference on a difference of means, <m>\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}</m>.
      We will use the <m>t</m>-distribution just as we did when carrying out inference on a single mean.
      The assumptions are that the observations are independent,
      both between groups and within groups and that the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}</m> is nearly normal.
      We check whether these assumptions are reasonable by verifying the following conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>Independent.</alert> Observations can be considered independent when the data are collected from two independent random samples or,
      in the context of experiments,
      from two randomly assigned treatments.
      Randomly assigning subjects to treatments is equivalent to randomly assigning treatments to subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>Nearly normal sampling distribution.</alert>
      The sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}</m> will be nearly normal when the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}_{1}</m> and of <m>\bar{x}_{2}</m> are nearly normal,
      that is when both population distributions are nearly normal or both sample sizes are at least 30.
    </p>
    <p>
      As before, if the sample sizes are small and the population distributions are not known to be nearly normal,
      we look at the data for excessive skew or outliers.
      If we do no find excessive skew or outliers in either group,
      we consider the assumption that the populations are nearly normal to be reasonable.

    <title>Confidence intervals for a difference of means</title>
    <p>
      What's in a name?
      Are employers more likely to offer interviews or higher pay to prospective employees when the name on a resume suggests the candidate is a man versus a woman?
      This is a challenging question to tackle,
      because employers are influenced by many aspects of a resume.
      Thinking back to <xref ref="introductionToData"></xref> on data collection,
      we could imagine a host of confounding factors associated with name and gender.
      How could we possibly isolate just the factor of name?
      We would need an experiment in which name was the only variable and everything else was held constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Researchers at Yale carried out precisely this experiment.
      Their results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).<fn><url href="https://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474">https://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474</url>
      </fn> The researchers sent out resumes to faculty at academic institutions for a lab manager position.
      The resumes were identical,
      except that on half of them the applicant's name was John and on the other half,
      the applicant's name was Jennifer.
      They wanted to see if faculty,
      specifically faculty trained in conducting scientifically objective research,
      held implicit gender biases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike in the matched pairs scenario,
      each faculty member received only one resume.
      We are interested in comparing the mean salary offered to John relative to the mean salary offered to Jennifer.
      Instead of taking the average of a set of paired differences,
      we find the average of each group separately and take their difference.
      Let

    </p>
    <p>
      We will use <m>\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}</m> as our point estimate for <m>\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}</m>.
      The data is given in the table below.

      We can calculate the difference as

        <mrow>\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2} = 30238 - 26508 = 3730</mrow>
      </md>.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Interpret the point estimate 3730.
          Why might we want to construct a confidence interval?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The average salary offered to John was $3,730 higher than the average salary offered to Jennifer.
          Because there is randomness in which faculty ended up in the John group and which faculty ended up in the Jennifer group,
          we want to see if the difference of $3,730 is beyond what could be expected by random variation.
          In order to answer this,
          we will first want to calculate the <m>SE</m> for the difference of sample means.

          Using samples of size <m>n_{1}</m> and <m>n_{2}</m>, the typical error when using <m>\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}</m> to estimate <m>\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}</m>,
          the real difference in mean salary that the faculty would offer John versus Jennifer,
          is $1151.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      We see that the difference of sample means of $3,730 is more than 3 <m>SE</m> above 0, which makes us think that the difference being 0 is unreasonable.
      We would like to construct a 95% confidence interval for the theoretical difference in mean salary that would be offered to John versus Jennifer.
      For this, we need the degrees of freedom associated with a two-sample <m>t</m>-interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the one-sample <m>t</m>-procedure,
      the degrees of freedom is given by the simple expression <m>n-1</m>,
      where <m>n</m> is the sample size.
      For the two-sample <m>t</m>-procedures, however,
      there is a complex formula for calculating the degrees of freedom,
      which is based on the two sample sizes and the two sample standard deviations.
      In practice,
      we find the degrees of freedom using software or a calculator
      (see <xref ref="x2SampTint"></xref>).
      If this is not possible,
      the alternative is to use the smaller of <m>n_{1}-1</m> and <m>n_{2}-1</m>.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Degrees of freedom for two-sample T-procedures</title>
      <p>
        Use statistical software or a calculator to compute the degrees of freedom for two-sample <m>t</m>-procedures . If this is not possible,
        use the smaller of <m>n_{1}-1</m> and <m>n_{2}-1</m>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Verify that conditions are met for a two-sample <m>t</m>-test.
          Then, construct the 95% confidence interval for the difference of means.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We noted previously that this is an experiment and that the two treatments
          (name Jennifer and name John)
          were randomly assigned.
          Also, both sample sizes are well over 30,
          so the distribution of <m>\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2</m> is nearly normal.
          Using a calculator, we find that <m>df= 118.1</m>.
          Since 118.1 is not on the <m>t</m>-table,
          we round the degrees of freedom down to 100.<fn>Using technology, we get a more precise interval, based on 118.1 <m>df</m>: <m>(1461, 5999)</m>.</fn> Using a <m>t</m>-table at row <m>df=100</m> with 95% confidence,
          we get a <m>t^{\star}</m> = 1.984.
          We calculate the confidence interval as follows.
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{ point estimate }  \amp \pm \ t^{\star}\times SE \text{ of estimate }</mrow>
            <mrow>3730\ \amp \pm \ 1.984\times 1151</mrow>
            <mrow>= 3730\ \amp \pm \ 2284</mrow>
            <mrow>= (1446\amp , 6014)</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Based on this interval,
      we are 95% confident that the true difference in mean salary that these faculty would offer John versus Jennifer is between $1,495 and $6,055.
      That is, we are 95% confident that the mean salary these faculty would offer John for a lab manager position is between $1,446 and $6,014 <em>more</em>
      than the mean salary they would offer Jennifer for the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results of these studies and others like it are alarming and disturbing.<fn>
      A similar study sent out identical resumes with different names to investigate the importance of perceived race.
      Resumes with a name commonly perceived to be for a White person (e.g.
      Emily) were 50% more likely to receive a callback than the same resume with a name commonly perceived to be for a Black person (e.g.
      Lakisha). <xref ref="appendix_data_sets_in_text"></xref> - see <c>resume</c> data set.</fn> One aspect that makes this bias so difficult to address is that the experiment,
      as well-designed as it was,
      cannot send us much signal about <em>which</em>
      faculty are discriminating.
      Each faculty member received only one of the resumes.
      A faculty member that offered
      <q>Jennifer</q>
      a very low salary may have also offered
      <q>John</q>
      a very low salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      We might imagine an experiment in which each faculty received both resumes,
      so that we could compare how much they would offer a Jennifer versus a John.
      However, the matched pairs scenario is clearly not possible in this case,
      because what makes the experiment work is that the resumes are
      <em>exactly the same</em> except for the name.
      An employer would notice something fishy if they received two identical resumes.
      It is only possible to say that overall,
      the faculty were willing to offer John more money for the lab manager position than Jennifer.
      Finding proof of bias for individual cases is a persistent challenge in enforcing anti-discrimination laws.

        <p>
          An instructor decided to run two slight variations of the same exam.
          Prior to passing out the exams,
          she shuffled the exams together to ensure each student received a random version.
          Summary statistics for how students performed on these two exams are shown in <xref ref="summaryStatsForTwoVersionsOfExams2nd"></xref>.
          Anticipating complaints from students who took Version B, she would like to evaluate whether the difference observed in the groups is so large that it provides convincing evidence that Version B was more difficult
          (on average)
          than Version A. Use a 95% confidence interval to estimate the difference in average score:
          version A - version B.

          </p>
          <p>
            <alert>Check</alert>: The data was collected from a randomized experiment with two treatments: Version A and Version B of test. The 10% condition does not need to be checked here since we are not sampling from a population. There were 30 students in each group, so the condition that both group sizes are at least 30 is met.
          </p>
          <p>
            <alert>Calculate</alert>: We will calculate the confidence interval as follows.
            <md>
              <mrow>\text{ point estimate } \ \pm\ t^{\star} \times SE\ \text{ of estimate }</mrow>
            </md>

          <p>
            The point estimate is the difference of sample means:
            <md>
              <mrow>\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2 = 79.4 - 74.1 = 5.3</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            The <m>SE</m> of a difference of sample means is:
            <md>
              <mrow>\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{14^2}{30} + \frac{20^2}{30}} = 4.46</mrow>
            </md>

          <p>
            In order to find the critical value <m>t^{\star}</m>,
            we must first find the degrees of freedom.
            Using a calculator, we find <m>df=51.9</m>.
            We round down to 50, and using a <m>t</m>-table at row <m>df = 50</m> and confidence level 95%, we get <m>t^{\star} = 2.009</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 95% confidence interval is given by:
            <md>
              <mrow>(79.4 - 74.1) \ \pm\  \amp 2.009\times \sqrt{\frac{14^2}{30} + \frac{20^2}{30}}   \qquad df = 45.97</mrow>
              <mrow>5.3 \ \pm\  \amp 2.009\times 4.46</mrow>
              <mrow>=(-3.66, 14.26)</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            <alert>Conclude</alert>: We are 95% confident that the true difference in average score between Version A and Version B is between -2.5 and 13.1 points.
            Because the interval contains both positive and negative values,
            the data do not convincingly show that one exam version is more difficult than the other,
            and the teacher should not be convinced that she should add points to the Version B exam scores.

      Four cases from a data set called <c>ncbirths</c>,

      We are particularly interested in two variables: <c>weight</c> and <c>smoke</c>.
      The <c>weight</c> variable represents the weights of the newborns and the <c>smoke</c> variable describes which mothers smoked during pregnancy.
      We would like to know,
      is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who don't smoke?
      The smoking group includes a random sample of 50 cases and the nonsmoking group contains a random sample of 100 cases,

      We check the two conditions necessary to use the <m>t</m>-distribution to the difference in sample means. (1)<nbsp/>Because the data come from a sample,
      we need there to be two independent random samples.
      In fact, there was only one random sample,
      but it is reasonable that the two groups here are independent of each other,
      so we will consider the assumption of independence reasonable. (2)<nbsp/>The sample sizes of 50 and 100 are well over 30,
      so we do not worry about the distributions of the original populations.
      Since both conditions are satisfied,
      the difference in sample means may be modeled using a <m>t</m>-distribution.

          This p-value of 0.130 is larger the significance level of 0.05,

          Not necessarily.

            The point estimate is the difference of sample means:
            <md>
              <mrow>\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}=3.50 - (-4.33) = 7.83</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            The <m>SE</m> of a difference of sample means:
            <m>\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}= \sqrt{\frac{(5.17)^2}{9} + \frac{(2.76)^2}{9}} = 1.95</m>
            <md>
              <mrow>T = \frac{3.50 - (-4.33) - 0}{\sqrt{\frac{(5.17)^2}{9} + \frac{(2.76)^2}{9}} } = \frac{7.83 - 0}{1.95} = 4.01</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            Because <m>H_A</m> is an upper tail test ( <m>></m> ), the p-value corresponds to the area to the right of <m>t=4.01</m> with the appropriate degrees of freedom.
            Using a calculator, we find get <m>df=12.2</m> and p-value
            <m>= 8.4\times 10^{-4}=0.00084</m>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <alert>Conclude</alert>: The p-value is much less than 0.05,
            so we reject the null hypothesis.
            There is sufficient evidence that embryonic stem cells improve the heart's pumping function in sheep that have suffered a heart attack.

          This section introduced inference for a difference of means,
          which is distinct from inference for a mean of differences.
          To calculate a difference of means,
          <m>\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2</m>,
          we first calculate the mean of each group,
          then we take the difference between those two numbers.
          To calculate a mean of difference,
          <m>\bar{x}_{\text{diff}}</m>,
          we first calculate all of the differences,
          then we find the mean of those differences.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Inference for a difference of means is based on the <m>t</m>-distribution.
          The degrees of freedom is complicated to calculate and we rely on a calculator or other software to calculate this.<fn>
          If this is not available, one can use <m>df=min(n_1-1, n_2-1)</m>.
          </fn>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When there are two samples or treatments and the parameter of interest is a difference of means:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Estimate <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m> at the C% confidence level using a
                <term>2-sample t-interval</term>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Test <m>H_0</m>: <m>\mu_1-\mu_2=0</m> at the <m>\alpha</m> significance level using a
                <term>2-sample t-test</term> .
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The 2-sample t-test and t-interval require the sampling distribution for <m>\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}</m> to be nearly normal. For this reason we must check that the following conditions are met.
          <ol marker="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                Independence: The data should come from 2 independent random samples or from a randomized experiment with 2 treatments. When sampling without replacement, check that the sample size is less than 10% of the population size for each sample.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Large samples or normal populations: <m>n_1\ge 30</m> and <m>n_2\ge 30</m> or both population distributions are nearly normal. If the sample sizes are less than 30 and it is not known that both population distributions are nearly normal, check for excessive skew or outliers in the data. If neither exists, the condition that both population distributions could be nearly normal is considered reasonable.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When the conditions are met,
          we calculate the confidence interval and the test statistic as follows.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Confidence interval:<nbsp/> <m>\text{ point estimate } \ \pm\ t^{\star} \times SE\ \text{ of estimate }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Test statistic:
                <m>T = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value} }{SE \text{ of estimate } }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here the point estimate is the difference of sample means:
          <m>\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <m>SE</m> of estimate is the <m>SE</m> of a difference of sample means:
          <m>\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1}+\frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Find and record the <m>df</m> using a calculator or other software.

  <title>Diamonds, Part I</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prices of diamonds are determined by what is known as the 4 Cs:
        cut, clarity, color, and carat weight.
        The prices of diamonds go up as the carat weight increases,
        but the increase is not smooth.
        For example,
        the difference between the size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye,
        but the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 diamond.
        In this question we use two random samples of diamonds, 0.99 carats and 1 carat,
        each sample of size 23, and compare the average prices of the diamonds.
        In order to be able to compare equivalent units,
        we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats.
        That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond,
        we divide the price by 99.
        For a 1 carat diamond, we divide the price by 100.
        The distributions and some sample statistics are shown below.<fn>H. Wickham. <url href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/book">ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis.</url> Springer New York, 2009.</fn>

        Conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate if there is a difference between the
        average standardized prices of 0.99 and 1 carat diamonds. Make sure to state
        your hypotheses clearly, check relevant conditions, and interpret your results
        in context of the data.

Check: Independence: Both samples are random and represent less than 10% of their respective populations. Also, we have no reason to think that the 0.99 carats are not independent of the 1 carat diamonds since they are both sampled randomly. Normal populations: The sample distributions are not very skewed, hence we find it reasonable that the underlying population distributions are nearly normal. Calculate: <m>T = âˆ’2.82</m>, <m>df = 42.5</m>, <m>\text{p-value} = 0.007</m>. Conclude: Since <m>\text{p-value} \lt 0.05</m>, reject <m>H_{0}</m>. The data provide convincing evidence that the average standardized price of 0.99 carats and 1 carat diamondsare different.

        Chicken farming is a multi-billion dollar industry,
        and any methods that increase the growth rate of young chicks can reduce consumer costs while increasing company profits,
        possibly by millions of dollars.
        An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens.
        Newly hatched chicks were randomly allocated into six groups,
        and each group was given a different feed supplement.
        Below are some summary statistics from this data set along with box plots showing the distribution of weights by feed type.<fn><url href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/chickwts.html">Chicken Weights by Feed Type</url>, from the datasets package in R.</fn>

        Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC, volunteered for an experiment involving an
        <q>isolation</q>
        experience.
        The goal of the experiment was to find a treatment that reduces subjects' psychopathic deviant T scores.
        This score measures a person's need for control or their rebellion against control,
        and it is part of a commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test.
        The experiment had three treatment groups:
        <ol marker="1">
          <li>
            <p>
              Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute

              Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute

        Forty-two subjects were randomly assigned to these treatment groups,

        Let <m>\mu_{diff} = \mu_{pre}-\mu_{post}</m>. <m>H_{0}: \mu_{diff} = 0:</m> Treatment has no effect. <m>H_{A}: \mu_{diff} \neq 0</m>. Treatment has an effect on P.D.T. scores, either positive or negative. Conditions: The subjects are randomly assigned to treatments, so independence within and between groups is satisfied. All three sample sizes are smaller than 30, so we look for clear outliers. There is a borderline outlier in the first treatment group. Since it is borderline, we will proceed, but we should report this caveat with any results. For all three groups: <m>df = 13</m>. <m>T_{1} = 1.89 \rightarrow (\text{p-value } = 0.081</m>, <m>T_{2} = 1.35 \rightarrow (\text{p-value } = 0.200)</m>, <m>T_{3} = -1.40 \rightarrow (\text{p-value } = 0.185)</m>. We do not reject the null hypothesis for any of these groups. As earlier noted, there is some uncertainty about if the method applied is reasonable for the first group.

    <title>True / False: comparing means</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Determine if the following statements are true or false,
        and explain your reasoning for statements you identify as false.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              When comparing means of two samples where <m>n_1 = 20</m> and <m>n_2 = 40</m>,
              we can use the normal model for the difference in means since <m>n_2 \ge 30</m>.

  <title>Chapter Highlights</title>
    <p>
      We've reviewed a wide set of inference procedures over the last 3 chapters.
      Let's revisit each and discuss the similarities and differences among them.
      The following confidence intervals and tests are structurally the same <mdash/> they all involve inference on a population parameter,
      where that parameter is a proportion,
      a difference of proportions,
      a mean, a mean of differences, or a difference of means.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          1-proportion <m>z</m>-test/interval
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          2-proportion <m>z</m>-test/interval
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          1-sample <m>t</m>-test/interval
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          1-sample <m>t</m>-test/interval with paired data
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          2-sample <m>t</m>-test/interval
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The above inferential procedures all involve a
    <term>point estimate</term>,
    a <term>standard error</term> of the estimate,
    and an assumption about the <term>shape of the sampling distribution</term> of the point estimate.
  </p>
  <p>
    From <xref ref="inferenceForCategoricalData"></xref>,
    the <m>\chi^2</m> tests and their uses are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\chi^2</m> goodness of fit - compares a categorical variable to a known/fixed distribution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\chi^2</m> test of homogeneity - compares a categorical variable across multiple groups.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\chi^2</m> test of independence - looks for association between two categorical variables.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>\chi^2</m> is a measure of <em>overall</em>
    deviation between observed values and expected values.
    These tests stand apart from the others because when using <m>\chi^2</m> there is not a parameter of interest.
    For this reason there are no confidence intervals using <m>\chi^2</m>.
    Also, for <m>\chi^2</m> tests,
    the hypotheses are usually written in words,
    because they are about the <em>distribution</em>
    of one or more categorical variables,
    not about a single parameter.
  </p>
  <p>
    While formulas and conditions vary,
    all of these procedures follow the same basic logic and process.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For a confidence interval,
          identify the parameter to be estimated and the confidence level.
          For a hypothesis test,
          identify the hypotheses to be tested and the significance level.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Choose the correct procedure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Check that both conditions for its use are met.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Calculate the confidence interval or the test statistic and p-value,
          as well as the <m>df</m> if applicable.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Interpret the results and draw a conclusion based on the data.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
