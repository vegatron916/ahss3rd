      <p>
        In a class of 25 students, 24 of them took an exam in class and 1 student took a make-up exam the following day. The professor graded the first batch of 24 exams and found an average score of 74 points with a standard deviation of 8.9 points. The student who took the make-up the following day scored 64 points on the exam.

  <title>Infant mortality</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The infant mortality rate is defined as the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births. This rate is often used as an indicator of the level of health in a country. The relative frequency histogram below shows the distribution of estimated infant death rates for 224 countries in 2014.<fn>CIA Factbook, <url href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/rankorderguide.html"> Country Comparison, 2014.</url></fn>

    <title>TV watchers</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Students in an AP Statistics class were asked how many hours of television they watch per week (including online streaming). This sample yielded an average of 4.71 hours, with a standard deviation of 4.18 hours. Is the distribution of number of hours students watch television weekly symmetric? If not, what shape would you expect this distribution to have? Explain your reasoning.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        No, we would expect this distribution to be right skewed. There are two reasons for this: (1) there is a natural boundary at 0 (it is not possible to watch less than 0 hours of TV), (2) the standard deviation of the distribution is very large compared to the mean.

    <solution>
      <p>
        The distribution of ages of best actress winners are right skewed with a median around 30 years. The distribution of ages of best actress winners is also right skewed, though less so, with a median around 40 years. The difference between the peaks of these distributions suggest that best actress winners are typically younger than best actor winners. The ages of best actress winners are more variable than the ages of best actor winners. There are potential outliers on the higher end of both of the distributions.

        In a large study of birth weight of newborns,
        the weights of 23,419 newborn boys were recorded.
        The distribution of weights was approximately normal with a mean of 7.44 lbs (3376 grams) and a standard deviation of 1.33 lbs (603 grams).

    <title>Heights of 10 year olds, Part I</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Heights of 10 year olds, regardless of gender, closely follow a normal distribution with mean 55 inches and standard deviation 6 inches.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                What is the probability that a randomly chosen 10 year old is shorter than 48 inches?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                What is the probability that a randomly chosen 10 year old is between 60 and 65 inches?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If the tallest 10% of the class is considered <q>very tall</q>, what is the height cutoff for <q>very tall</q>?
