  <title>Sampling distribution of a sample mean</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      If bags of chips are produced with an average weight of 15 oz and a standard deviation of 0.1 oz,
      what is the probability that the average weight of 30 bags will be within 0.1 oz of the mean?
      The answer is not 68%! To answer this question we must visualize and understand what is called the
      <em>sampling distribution</em> for a sample mean.

      <title>Sampling distribution</title>
      <p>
        The sampling distribution represents the distribution of the point estimates based on samples of a fixed size from a certain population.
        It is useful to think of a point estimate as being drawn from such a distribution.
        Understanding the concept of a sampling distribution is central to understanding statistical inference.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      The sampling distribution shown in <xref ref="netTime1000SamplingDistribution"></xref>
      is unimodal and approximately symmetric.
      It is also centered exactly at the true population mean:
      <m>\mu=94.52</m>.
      Intuitively, this makes sense.
      The sample mean should be an unbiased estimator of the population mean.
      Because we are considering the distribution of the sample mean,
      we will use <m>\mu_{\bar{x}} = 94.52</m> to describe the true mean of this distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can see that the sample mean has some variability around the population mean,
      which can be quantified using the standard deviation of this distribution of sample means.
      The standard deviation of the sample mean tells us how far the typical estimate is away from the actual population mean, 94.52 minutes.
      It also describes the typical <term>error</term> of a single estimate,
      and is denoted by the symbol <m>\sigma_{\bar{x}}</m>.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Standard deviation of an estimate</title>
      <p>
        The standard deviation associated with an estimate describes the typical error or uncertainty associated with the estimate.

          Looking at <xref ref="run17sampHistograms"></xref>
          and <xref ref="netTime1000SamplingDistribution"></xref>,
          we see that the standard deviation of the sample mean with <m>n=100</m> is much smaller than the standard deviation of a single sample.
          Interpret this statement and explain why it is true.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The variation from one sample mean to another sample mean is much smaller than the variation from one individual to another individual.
          This makes sense because when we average over 100 values,
          the large and small values tend to cancel each other out.
          While many individuals have a time under 90 minutes,
          it would be unlikely for the <em>average</em>
          of 100 runners to be less than 90 minutes.

Individual observations in the small sample are highly influential on the estimate while in larger samples these individual observations would more often average each other out. The larger sample would tend to provide a more accurate estimate. (b) If we think an estimate is better, we probably mean it typically has less error.

      When considering how to calculate the standard deviation of a sample mean,
      there is one problem:
      there is no obvious way to estimate this from a single sample.
      However, statistical theory provides a helpful tool to address this issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sample of 100 runners,
      the standard deviation of the sample mean is equal to one-tenth of the population standard deviation:
      <m>15.93/10 = 1.59</m>.
      In other words,
      the standard deviation of the sample mean based on 100 observations is equal to
      <md>
        <mrow>SD_{\bar{x}} = \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma_{x}}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{15.93}{\sqrt{100}} = 1.59</mrow>
      </md>
      where <m>\sigma_{x}</m> is the standard deviation of the individual observations.
      This is no coincidence.
      We can show mathematically that this equation is correct when the observations are independent using the probability tools of <xref ref="randomVariablesSection"></xref>.

          <fn>(a) Extra observations are usually helpful in understanding the population, so a point estimate with 400 observations seems more trustworthy. (b) The standard deviation of the mean when the sample size is 100 is given by <m>SD_{100}=10/ \sqrt{100} = 1</m>. For <m>SD_{400}=10 / \sqrt{400}=0.5</m>. The larger sample has a smaller standard deviation ofthe mean. ( c) The standard deviation of the mean of the sample with 400 observations is lower than that of the sample with 100 observations. The standard deviation of <m>\bar{x}</m> describes the typical error, and since it is lower for the larger sample, this mathematically shows the estimate from the larger sample tends to be better - though it does not guarantee that every large sample will provide a better estimate than a particular small sample.</fn>

    <title>The Central Limit Theorem Revisted</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>Central Limit Theorem</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="netTime1000SamplingDistribution"></xref>,
      the sampling distribution of the sample mean looks approximately normally distributed.
      Will the sampling distribution of a mean always be nearly normal?
      To address this question,
      we will investigate three cases to see roughly when the approximation is reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We consider three data sets:
      one from a <em>uniform</em> distribution,
      one from an <em>exponential</em> distribution,
      and the other from a <em>normal</em> distribution.
      These distributions are shown in the top panels of <xref ref="cltSimulations"></xref>.
      The uniform distribution is symmetric,
      and the exponential distribution may be considered as having moderate skew since its right tail is relatively short
      (few outliers).
          <idx><h>skew</h><h>example: moderate</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      The left panel in the <m>n=2</m> row represents the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> if it is the sample mean of two observations from the uniform distribution shown.
      The dashed line represents the closest approximation of the normal distribution.
      Similarly, the center and right panels of the <m>n=2</m> row represent the respective distributions of <m>\bar{x}</m> for data from exponential and log-normal distributions.

      <image width="90%" source="images/distributions/cltSimulations.png" />

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Examine the distributions in each row of <xref ref="cltSimulations"></xref>.
          What do you notice about the sampling distribution of the mean as the sample size,
          <m>n</m>,
          becomes larger?
          <fn>The normal approximation becomes better as larger samples are used.
          However, in the case when the population is normally distributed,
          the normal distribution of the sample mean is normal for all sample sizes.</fn>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In general, would normal approximation for a sample mean be appropriate when the sample size is at least 30?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Yes, the sampling distributions when <m>n = 30</m> all look very much like the normal distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the more non-normal a population distribution,
          the larger a sample size is necessary for the sampling distribution to look nearly normal.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Determining if the sample mean is normally distributed</title>
      <p>
        If the population is normal,
        the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> will be normal for any sample size.
      </p>
      <p>
        The less normal the population,
        the larger <m>n</m> needs to be for the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> to be nearly normal.
        However, a good rule of thumb is that for almost all populations,
        the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> will be approximately normal if <m>n \ge 30</m>.

      This brings us to the <term>Central Limit Theorem</term>,
      the most fundamental theorem in Statistics.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Central Limit Theorem</title>
      <p>
        When taking a random sample of independent observations from a population with a fixed mean and standard deviation,
        the distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> approaches the normal distribution as <m>n</m> increases.

    </assemblage>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Sometimes we do not know what the population distribution looks like.
          We have to infer it based on the distribution of a single sample.

          Based on this sample data,
          can the normal approximation be applied to the distribution of the sample mean?

                There are two outliers in the data, both quite extreme,
                which suggests the population may not be normal and instead may be very strongly skewed or have distant outliers.
                Outliers can play an important role and affect the distribution of the sample mean and the estimate of the standard deviation of the sample mean.

          Since we should be skeptical of the independence of observations and the extreme upper outliers pose a challenge,
          we should not use the normal model for the sample mean of these 20 observations.
          If we can obtain a much larger sample,
          then the concerns about skew and outliers would no longer apply.

        Strong skew in the population is often identified by the presence of clear outliers in the data.
        If a data set has prominent outliers,
        then a larger sample size will be needed for the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> to be normal.
        There are no simple guidelines for what sample size is big enough for each situation.
        However, we can use the rule of thumb that, in general,

    <title>Normal approximation for the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m></title>
    <p>
      At the beginning of this chapter,
      we used normal approximation for populations or for data that had an approximately normal distribution.
      When appropriate conditions are met,
      we can also use the normal approximation to estimate probabilities about a sample average.
      We must remember to verify that the conditions are met and use the mean
      <m>\mu_{\bar{x}}</m> and standard deviation
      <m>\sigma_{\bar{x}}</m> for the sampling distribution of the sample average.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
    <title>Three important facts about the distribution of a sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m></title>
      <p>
         When the observations can be considered independent, such as from a random sample of less than 10% of the population, the distribution of the sample mean can be described as follows.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The mean of a sample mean is denoted by <m>\mu_{\bar{x}}</m>,
              and it is equal to <m>\mu</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The SD of a sample mean is denoted by <m>\sigma_{\bar{x}}</m>,
              and it is equal to <m>\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              When the population is normal or when <m>n\ge 30</m>,
              the sample mean closely follows a normal distribution.
            </p>
          </li>

    </assemblage>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In the 2012 Cherry Blossom 10 mile run,
          the average time for all of the runners is 94.52 minutes with a standard deviation of 8.97 minutes.
          The distribution of run times is approximately normal.
          Find the probabiliy that a randomly selected runner completes the run in less than 90 minutes.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Because the distribution of run times is approximately normal,
          we can use normal approximation.

      <solution>
        <p>
          Here, <m>n=20\lt 30</m>,
          but the distribution of the population, that is,
          the distribution of run times is stated to be approximately normal.
          Because of this,
          the sampling distribution will be normal for any sample size.

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a 1.23% probability that the average run time of 20 randomly selected runners will be less than 90 minutes.

      <statement>
        <p>
          The average of all the runners' ages is 35.05 years with a standard deviation of <m>\sigma = 8.97</m>.
          The distribution of age is somewhat skewed.
          What is the probability that a randomly selected runner is older than 37 years?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Because the distribution of age is skewed and is not normal,
          we cannot use normal approximation for this problem.
          In order to answer this question,
          we would need to look at all of the data.

        <p>
          What is the probability that the average of 50 randomly selected runners is greater than 37 years?
          <fn>Because <m>n = 50 \ge 30</m>, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal, so we can use normal approximation for this problem. The mean is given as 35.05 years. <m>\sigma_{x} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{8.97}{\sqrt{50}} = 1.27</m>, <m>z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_{x}}{\sigma_{x}} = \frac{37-35.05}{1.27} = 1.535</m>, <m>P(Z>1.535)=0.062</m> There is a 6.2% chance that the average age of 50 runners will be greater than 37.</fn>

              Even though the population distribution is not normal, the conditions for inference are reasonably satisfied, with the possible exception of skew. If the skew isn't very strong (we should ask to see the data), then we can use the Central Limit Theorem to estimate this probability. For now, we'll assume the skew isn't very strong, though the description suggests it is at least moderate to strong.

        Each year about 1500 students take the introductory statistics course at a large university.
        This year scores on the final exam are distributed with a median of 74 points,
        a mean of 70 points, and a standard deviation of 10 points.
        There are no students who scored above 100
        (the maximum score attainable on the final)
        but a few students scored below 20 points.

        The centers are the same in each plot, and each data set is from a nearly normal distribution, though the histograms may not look very normal since each represents only 100 data points. The only way to tell which plot corresponds to which scenario is to examine the variability of each distribution. Plot B is the most variable, followed by Plot A, then Plot C. This means Plot B will correspond to the original data, Plot A to the sample means with size 5, and Plot C to the sample means with size 25.

            <p>
              We cannot use the normal model for this calculation, but we can use the histogram. About 500 songs are shown to be longer than 5 minutes, so the probability is about <m>500/3000 = 0.167</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              Two different answers are reasonable. Option 1: Since the population distribution is only slightly skewed to the right, even a small sample size will yield a nearly normal sampling distribution. We also know that the songs are sampled randomly and the sample size is less than 10% of the population, so the length of one song in the sample is independent of another. We are looking for the probability that the total length of 15 songs is more than 60 minutes, which means that  the average song should last at least <m>60/15 = 4</m> minutes. Using <m>SD_{x} = 1.63/\sqrt{15}</m>, <m>Z = 1.31 \rightarrow 0.0951</m>. Option 2: Since the population distribution is not normal, a small sample size may not be sufficient to yield a nearly normal sampling distribution. Therefore, we cannot estimate the probability using the tools we have learned so far.
