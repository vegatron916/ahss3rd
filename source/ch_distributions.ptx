  <title>Sampling Distributions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      At the end of the previous chapter, we explored the Geometric Distribution and the Binomial Distribution. In this chapter, we consider what is called the <em>sampling distribution</em>, which is a term for describing the distribution of a statistic. For example, if we take a survey of a random sample of a population and compute the proportion of <q>yes</q> responses to a particular question, then itâ€™s helpful to consider the distribution of all possible sample proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We explore sampling distributions for two common statistics: the sample proportion and the sample mean. We then consider the distributions of a difference of sample proportions and a difference of sample means. In each case, the goal is the same <mdash/> to describe the center, spread, and shape of the sampling distribution and determine when the normal approximation to the sampling distribution is reasonable.
