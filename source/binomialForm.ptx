      What is the probability of exactly 50 heads in 100 coin tosses?
      Or the probability of randomly sampling 12 people and having more than 9 of them identify as male?
      If the probability of a defective part is 1%, how many defective items would we expect in a random shipment of 200 of those parts? We can model these scenarios and answer these questions using the binomial distribution.

    <title>Introducing the binomial formula</title>
    <!-- <p>
      Many health insurance plans in the United States have a deductible,
      where the insured individual is responsible for costs up to the deductible,
      and then the costs above the deductible are shared between the individual and insurance company for the remainder of the year.
    </p> -->
    <p>
      <!-- Suppose a health insurance company found that 70% of the people they insure stay below their deductible in any given year. -->
      
      Letâ€™s again imagine ourselves back at the insurance agency where 70% of individuals do not exceed their deductible.
      Each people can be thought of as a <term>trial</term>.
      We label a trial a <term>success</term>
      if the individual healthcare costs do not exceed the deductible.
      We label a trial a <term>failure</term>
      if the individual healthcare costs do exceed her deductible.
      Because 70% of the individuals will not hit their deductible,
      we denote the <term>probability of a success</term>
      as <m>p = 0.7</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose the insurance agency is considering a random sample of four individuals they insure.
          What is the chance exactly one of them will exceed the deductible and the other three will not?
          Let's call the four people Ariana (<m>A</m>), Brittany (<m>B</m>), Carlton (<m>C</m>),
          and Damian (<m>D</m>) for convenience.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution xml:id="insureOneOfFourExceedsDeductible">
        <p>
          Let's consider a scenario where one person exceeds the deductible:
          <md>
            <mrow>\amp P(A=\text{exceed, } B= \text{not, } C=\text{not, } D= \text{not} )</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = P(A=\text{exceed} )\ P(B=\text{not} )\ P(C=\text{not} )\ P(D=\text{not} )</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  =  (0.3)(0.7)(0.7) (0.7)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = (0.7)^3 (0.3)^1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = 0.103</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are three other scenarios: Brittany, Carlton,
          or Damian could have been the one to exceed the deductible.
          In each of these cases,
          the probability is again <m>(0.7)^3 (0.3)^1</m>.
          These four scenarios exhaust all the possible ways that exactly one of these four people could have exceeded the deductible,
          so the total probability is <m>4 \times (0.7)^3 (0.3)^1 =0.412</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Verify that the scenario where Brittany is the only one to exceed the deductible has probability <m>(0.7)^3 (0.3)^1</m>.
          <fn><m>P(A= \text{not, } B= \text{exceed, } C=\text{not, } D=\text{not}) =(0.7)(0.3)(0.7)(0.7)=(0.7)^3(0.3)^1</m></fn>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      The binomial distribution describes the probability of having exactly <m>x</m> successes in <m>n</m> independent trials with probability of a success <m>p</m>
      (in <xref ref="insureOneOfFourExceedsDeductible">Example</xref>,
      <m>n=4</m>,
      <m>x=3</m>, <m>p=0.7</m>).
      We would like to determine the probabilities associated with the binomial distribution more generally,
      i.e. we want a formula where we can use <m>n</m>, <m>x</m>,
      and <m>p</m> to obtain the probability.
      To do this, we reexamine each part of <xref ref="insureOneOfFourExceedsDeductible">Example</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were four individuals who could have been the one to exceed the deductible,
      and each of these four scenarios had the same probability.
      Thus, we could identify the final probability as
      <md>
        <mrow>[ \text{number of scenarios}] \times P(\text{single scenario} )</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first component of this equation is the number of ways to arrange the <m>x=3</m> successes among the <m>n=4</m> trials.
      The second component is the probability of any of the four
      (equally probable)
      scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider <m>P(\text{single scenario})</m> under the general case of <m>x</m> successes and <m>n-x</m> failures in the <m>n</m> trials.
      In any such scenario,
      we apply the Multiplication Rule for independent events:
      <md>
        <mrow>p^x (1 - p)^{n - x}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is our general formula for <m>P(\text{single scenario})</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, we introduce the <term>binomial coefficient</term>,
      which gives the number of ways to choose <m>x</m> successes in <m>n</m> trials,
      i.e. arrange <m>x</m> successes and <m>n - x</m> failures:
      <md>
        <mrow>{n \choose x} = \frac{n!}{x! (n - x)!}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The quantity <m>{n \choose x}</m> is read
      <term>n choose x</term>.<fn>
      Other notations for <m>n</m> choose <m>x</m> includes <m>_nC_x</m>,
      <m>C_n^x</m>, and <m>C(n,x)</m>.
      </fn> The exclamation point notation (e.g.
      <m>n!</m>) denotes a <term>factorial</term> expression.
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp  0! = 1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  1! = 1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  2! = 2\times1 = 2</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  3! = 3\times2\times1 = 6</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  4! = 4\times3\times2\times1 = 24</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  \vdots</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  n! = n\times(n-1)\times...\times3\times2\times1</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the formula,
      we can compute the number of ways to choose <m>x = 3</m> successes in <m>n = 4</m> trials:
      <md>
        <mrow>{4 \choose 3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4!}{3!1!} = \frac{4\times3\times2\times1}{(3\times2\times1) (1)} = 4</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This result is exactly what we found by carefully thinking of each possible scenario in <xref ref="insureOneOfFourExceedsDeductible">Example</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Substituting <m>n</m> choose <m>x</m> for the number of scenarios and
      <m>p^x(1-p)^{n-x}</m> for the single scenario probability yields the
      <term>binomial formula</term>.

        Suppose the probability of a single trial being a success is <m>p</m>.

          <mrow>P(X=x)={n\choose x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x} = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}</mrow>

          What is the probability that 3 of 8 randomly selected individuals will have exceeded the insurance deductible,
          i.e. that 5 of 8 will not exceed the deductible?
          Recall that 70% of individuals will not exceed the deductible.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We would like to apply the binomial model,
          so we check the conditions.
          The number of trials is fixed (<m>n = 8</m>) (condition 2) and each trial outcome can be classified as a success or failure
          (condition 3).
          Because the sample is random,
          the trials are independent (condition<nbsp/>1) and the probability of a success is the same for each trial
          (condition<nbsp/>4).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the outcome of interest,
          there are <m>x = 5</m> successes in <m>n = 8</m> trials (recall that a success is an individual who does
          <em>not</em> exceed the deductible,
          and the probability of a success is <m>p = 0.7</m>.
          So the probability that 5 of 8 will not exceed the deductible and 3 will exceed the deductible is given by
          <md>
            <mrow>{ 8 \choose 5}(0.7)^5 (1-0.7)^{8-5} \amp = \frac{8!}{5!(5-3)!} (0.7)^5(1-0.7)^{8-5}</mrow>

        </p>
        <p>
          Dealing with the factorial part:
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{8!}{5!3!} = \frac{8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1} {(5\times4\times3\times2\times1)(3\times2\times1)} = \frac{8\times7\times6}{3\times2\times1} = 56</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Using <m>(0.7)^5(0.3)^3 \approx 0.00454</m>,
          the final probability is about <m>56\times 0.00454 \approx 0.254</m>.

        The first step in using the binomial model is to check that the model is appropriate.
        The second step is to identify <m>n</m>, <m>p</m>, and <m>x</m>.
        Finally, apply the binomial formula to determine the probability and interpret the results.

      </statement>

          To check if the binomial model is appropriate,

                We will suppose that these 4 people comprise a random sample,
                then we can treat them as independent.
                This seems reasonable,
                since one person with a particular blood type showing up at a hospital seems unlikely to affect the chance that other people with that blood type would show up at the hospital.

            <mrow>P(X = 3) \amp = (\text{number of combinations with 3 blue } )\times P(\text{3 blue and 2 red in a specific order})</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp ={5\choose 3}\times P(\text{ BBBRR } )</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = {5\choose 3}\left(\frac{4}{13}\times \frac{3}{12}\times \frac{2}{11} \times \frac{9}{10} \times \frac{8}{9}\right)</mrow>

          <fn>Frame these expressions into words.
          How many different ways are there to arrange 0 successes and <m>n</m> failures in <m>n</m> trials? (1 way.) How many different ways are there to arrange <m>n</m> successes and 0 failures in <m>n</m> trials? (1 way.)</fn>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many ways can you arrange one success and <m>n-1</m> failures in <m>n</m> trials?
          How many ways can you arrange <m>n-1</m> successes and one failure in <m>n</m> trials?
          <fn>One success and <m>n-1</m> failures: there are exactly n unique places we can put the success, so there are <m>n</m> ways to arrange one success and <m>n-1</m> failures. A similar argument is used for the second question. Mathematically, we show these results by verifying the following two equations:<m>{n \choose 1}=n</m>, <m>{n \choose {n-1}}=n</m></fn>

    <title>An example of a binomial distribution</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="bloodTypeOPos"></xref>,
      we asked various probability questions regarding the number of people out of 4 with blood type O+. We verified that the scenario was binomial and that each problem could be solved using the binomial formula.
      Instead of looking at it piecewise,
      we could describe the entire <em>distribution</em>
      of possible values and their corresponding probabilities.
      Since there are 4 people,
      there are several possible outcomes for the number who might have blood type O+: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
      We can make a distribution table with these outcomes.
      Recall that the probability of a randomly sampled person being blood type O+ is about 0.35.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <term>binomial distribution</term> is used to describe the number of successes in a fixed number of trials. This is different from the geometric distribution, which described the number of trials we must wait before we observe a success.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="oPositive4">

    <p>
      The binomial formula is cumbersome when the sample size (<m>n</m>) is large,
      particularly when we consider a range of observations.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="exactbin">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the probability that fewer than 12 out of 40 randomly selected people would have blood type O+, where probability of blood type O+ is 0.35.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This is equivalent to asking,
          what is the probability of observing
          <m>X=0, 1, 2, ..., \text{ or }  11</m> with blood type O+ in a sample of size 40 when <m>p=0.35</m>?
          We previously verified that this scenario is binomial.
          We can compute each of the 12 probabilities using the binomial formula and add them together to find the answer:
          <md>
            <mrow>\amp P(X=0\text{ or } X=1\text{ or } \cdots\text{ or }  X=11)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \qquad = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + \cdots + P(X=11)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \qquad = {40\choose 0}(0.35)^0(0.65)^{40} + {40\choose 1}(0.35)^1(0.65)^{39} + \cdots + {40\choose 11}(0.35)^{11}(0.65)^{29}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \qquad = 0.21</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          If the true proportion with blood type O+ in the population is <m>p = 0.35</m>,
          then the probability of observing fewer than 12 in a sample of <m>n = 40</m> is 0.21.

    <p>
      The computations in <xref ref="exactbin"></xref> are tedious and long.
      In general, we should avoid such work if an alternative method exists that is faster,
      easier, and still accurate.
      Recall that calculating probabilities of a range of values is much easier in the normal model.
      In some cases we may use the normal distribution to estimate binomial probabilities.
      While a normal approximation for the distribution in <xref ref="oPositive4"></xref>
      when the sample size was <m>n = 4</m> would not be appropriate,
      it might not be too bad for the distribution in <xref ref="oPositive40"></xref> where <m>n = 40</m>.
      We might wonder,
      when is it reasonable to use the normal model to approximate a binomial distribution?
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Here we consider the binomial model when the probability of a success is <m>p=0.10</m>.
          <xref ref="fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal"></xref>
          shows four hollow histograms for simulated samples from the binomial distribution using four different sample sizes:
          <m>n=10, 30, 100, 300</m>.
          What happens to the shape of the distributions as the sample size increases?
          How does the binomial distribution change as <m>n</m> gets larger?
          <fn>The distribution is transformed from a blocky and skewed distribution into one that rather resembles the normal distribution in the last hollow histogram.</fn>

      </statement>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      The shape of the binomial distribution depends upon both <m>n</m> and <m>p</m>.
      Here we introduce a rule of thumb for when normal approximation of a binomial distribution is reasonable.
      We will use this rule of thumb in many applications going forward.

    <assemblage>
      <title>Normal approximation of the binomial distribution</title>
      <p>
        The binomial distribution with probability of success <m>p</m> is nearly normal when the sample size <m>n</m> is sufficiently large that
        <m>np\ge 10</m> and <m>n(1-p)\ge 10</m>.
        The approximate normal distribution has parameters corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of the binomial distribution:
        <md>
          <mrow>\mu \amp = np \amp \amp \sigma= \sqrt{np(1-p)}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      The normal approximation may be used when computing the range of many possible successes.
      For instance,
      we may apply the normal distribution to the setting described in <xref ref="oPositive40"></xref>.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="approxBinomialForN40P35OPosExample">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the normal approximation to estimate the probability of observing fewer than 12 with blood type O+ in a random sample of 40,
          if the true proportion with blood type O+ in the population is <m>p=0.35</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First we verify that <m>np</m> and <m>n(1-p)</m> are at least 10 so that we can apply the normal approximation to the binomial model:
          <md>
            <mrow>np\amp  = 40(0.35)=14\ge 10 \amp n(1-p)\amp  = 40(0.65) = 26\ge 10</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          With these conditions checked,
          we may use the normal distribution to approximate the binomial distribution with the following mean and standard deviation:
          <md>
            <mrow>\mu \amp = np = 40(0.35)=14</mrow>
            <mrow>\sigma \amp = \sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{40(0.35)(0.65)} = 3.0</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to find the probability of observing fewer than 12 with blood type O+ using this model.
          We note that 12 is less than 1 standard deviation below the mean:
        </p>
        <image width="65%" source="images/distributions/bloodtypeOpos40.png" />
        <p>
          Next,
          we compute the Z-score as <m>Z=\frac{12 - 14}{3} = -0.67</m> to find the shaded area in the picture:
          <m>P(Z \lt -0.67) = 0.25</m>.
          This probability of 0.25 using the normal approximation is reasonably close to the true probability of 0.21 computed using the binomial distribution.

        <p>
          We have previously verified that the binomial model is reasonable for this context.
          Now we will verify that both <m>np</m> and <m>n(1-p)</m> are at least 10 so we can apply the normal approximation to the binomial model:

        </p>
        <p>
          With these conditions checked,
          we may use the normal approximation in place of the binomial distribution with the following mean and standard deviation:
          <md>
            <mrow>\mu \amp = np = 400(0.35)=140</mrow>
            <mrow>\sigma \amp = \sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{400(0.35)(0.65)}= 9.5</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to find the probability of observing fewer than 120 with blood type O+ using this model.
          We note that 120 is just over 2<nbsp/>standard deviations below the mean:

        <image width="65%" source="images/distributions/bloodtypeOpos400.png" />
        <p>
          Next,
          we compute the Z-score as <m>Z=\frac{120 - 140}{9.5} = -2.1</m> to find the shaded area in the picture:
          <m>P(Z \lt -2.1) = 0.0179</m>.
          This probability of 0.0179 using the normal approximation is very close to the true probability of 0.0196 from the binomial distribution.

    <title>Normal approximation breaks down on small intervals (special topic)</title>
    <assemblage>
      <title>The normal approximation may fail on small intervals</title>
      <p>
        The normal approximation to the binomial distribution tends to perform poorly when estimating the probability of a small range of counts,
        even when the conditions are met.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      We consider again our example where 35% of people are blood type O+. Suppose we want to find the probability that between 129 and 131 people,
      inclusive,
      have blood type O+ in a random sample of 400 people.
      We want to compute the probability of observing 129, 130,
      or 131 people with blood type O+ when <m>p=0.20</m> and <m>n=400</m>.
      With such a large sample,
      we might be tempted to apply the normal approximation and use the range 129 to 131.
      However, we would find that the binomial solution and the normal approximation notably differ:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ Binomial: } \amp \ 0.0732 \amp \text{ Normal: } \amp \ 0.0483</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can identify the cause of this discrepancy using <xref ref="normApproxToBinomFail"></xref>,
      which shows the areas representing the binomial probability (outlined) and normal approximation
      (shaded).
      Notice that the width of the area under the normal distribution is 0.5 units too slim on both sides of the interval.
      The binomial distribution is a discrete distribution,
      and the each bar is centered over an integer value.
      Looking closely at <xref ref="normApproxToBinomFail"></xref>,
      we can see that the bar corresponding to 129 begins at 128.5 and ends at 129.5, the bar corresponding to 131 begins at 130.5 and ends at 131.5, etc.

      <title>Improving accuracy of the normal approximation to the binomial distribution</title>
      <p>
        The normal approximation to the binomial distribution for intervals of values is usually improved if cutoff values for the lower end of a shaded region are reduced by 0.5 and the cutoff value for the upper end are increased by 0.5.
        This correction is called the continuity correction and accounts for the fact that the binomial distribution is discrete.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the method described to find a more accurate estimate for the probability of observing 129, 130,
          or 131 people with blood type O+ in 400 randomly selected people when <m>p=0.35</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Instead of standardizing 129 and 131,
          we will standardize 128.5 and 131.5:
          <md>
            <mrow>Z_{left} \amp = \frac{128.5-140}{9.5} = -1.263</mrow>
            <mrow>Z_{right} \amp = \frac{131.5-140}{9.5} = -0.895</mrow>
            <mrow>P(-1.263 \amp \lt  Z \lt  -0.895) = 0.0772</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The probability 0.0772 is much closer to the true value of 0.0732 than the previous estimate of 0.0483 we calculated using normal approximation without the continuity correction.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      It is always possible to apply the continuity correction when finding a normal approximation to the binomial distribution.
      However, when <m>n</m> is very large or when the interval is wide,
      the benefit of the modification is limited since the added area becomes negligible compared to the overall area being calculated.

<subsection>
  <title>Chapter Highlights</title>
  <p>
    This chapter focused on understanding likelihood and chance variation,
    first by solving individual probability questions and then by investigating probability distributions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main probability techniques covered in this chapter are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>General Multiplication Rule</term> for <em>and</em>
          probabilities (intersection),
          along with the special case when events are <term>independent</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>General Addition Rule</term>
          for <em>or</em> probabilities (union),
          along with the special case when events are
          <term>mutually exclusive</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>Conditional Probability Rule</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Tree diagrams and <term>Bayes' Theorem</term>
          to solve more complex conditional problems.
        </p>
      </li>
<!--       <li>
        <p>
          The <em>Binomial Formula</em>
            <idx><h>binomial formula</h></idx>
          for finding the probability of exactly <m>x</m> successes in <m>n</m> independent trials.
        </p>
      </li> -->
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Simulations</term>
            <idx><h>simulation</h></idx>
          and the use of random digits to estimate probabilities.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Fundamental to all of these problems is understanding when events are independent and when they are mutually exclusive.
    Two events are <term>independent</term>
    when the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other, i.e.
    <m>P(A | B) = P(A)</m>.
    Two events are <term>mutually exclusive</term>
    when they cannot both happen together, i.e.
    <m>P(A \text{ and } B) = 0</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moving from solving individual probability questions to studying probability distributions helps us better understand chance processes and quantify expected chance variation.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For a <term>discrete probability distribution</term>,
          the <term>sum</term> of the probabilities must equal 1.
          <!-- For a <term>continuous probability distribution</term>,
          the <term>area under the curve</term>
          represents a probability and the total area under the curve must equal<nbsp/>1. -->
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          As with any distribution,
          one can calculate the mean and standard deviation of a probability distribution.
          In the context of a probability distribution,
          the <term>mean</term> and <term>standard deviation</term>
          describe the average and the typical deviation from the average,
          respectively,
          after many, many repetitions of the chance process.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

          A probability distribution can be summarized by its
          <term>center</term> (mean, median),
          <term>spread</term> (SD, IQR), and <term>shape</term>
          (right skewed, left skewed, approximately symmetric).
        </p>

          Adding a constant to every value in a probability distribution adds that value to the mean,
          but it does not affect the standard deviation.
          When multiplying every value by a constant,
          this multiplies the mean by the constant and it multiplies the standard deviation by the absolute value of the constant.

          The mean of the sum of two random variables equals the sum of the means.
          However, this is not true for standard deviations.
          Instead, when finding the standard deviation of a sum or difference of random variables,
          take the square root of the sum of each of the standard deviations squared.

          The <term>geometric distribution</term> provides a model for the number of trials until the first success, when the trials are independent.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
           The <term>binomial distribution</term> provides a model for the number of successes in n independent trials.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The geometric distribution is always right skewed. However, when the success-failure rule is met (at least 10 success and 10 failures), the binomial distribution can be modeled using a normal distribution with <m>\text{mean} = np</m> and standard deviation <m>\sqrt{np(1-p)}</m>.

    The study of probability is useful for measuring uncertainty and assessing risk.
    In addition,
    probability serves as the foundation for inference,
    providing a framework for evaluating when an outcome falls outside of the range of what would be expected by chance alone.
