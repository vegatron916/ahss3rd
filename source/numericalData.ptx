    <p>
      How do we visualize and describe the distribution of household income for counties within the United States?
      What shape would the distribution have?
      What other features might be important to notice?
      In this section,
      we will explore techniques for summarizing numerical variables.
      We will apply these techniques using county-level data from the US Census Bureau,
      which was introduced in <xref ref="dataBasics"></xref>,
      and a new data set <c>email50</c>,
      that comprises information on a random sample of 50 emails.

      Sometimes researchers wish to see the relationship between two variables.
      When we talk of a relationship or an association between variables,
      we are interested in how one variable behaves as the other variable increases or decreases.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <term>scatterplot</term> provides a case-by-case view of data that illustrates the relationship between two numerical variables.
      A scatterplot is shown in <xref ref="email50LinesCharacters"></xref>,
      illustrating the relationship between the number of line breaks (<c>line_breaks</c>) and number of characters (<c>num_char</c>) in emails for the <c>email50</c> data set.
      In any scatterplot, each point represents a single case.
      Since there are 50 cases in <c>email50</c>,
      there are 50 points in <xref ref="email50LinesCharacters"></xref>.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A scatterplot requires <term>bivariate</term>,

          What does paired data mean?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We say observations are <em>paired</em>
          when the two observations correspond to the same case or individual.
          In unpaired data, there is no such correspondence.
          In our example the two observations correspond to a particular email.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      The variable that is suspected to be the response variable is plotted on the vertical (y) axis and the variable that is suspected to be the explanatory variable is plotted on the horizontal (x) axis.
      In this example,
      the variables could be switched since either variable could reasonably serve as the explanatory variable or the response variable.

              Decide which variable should go on each axis,
              and draw and label the two axes.

      The association between two variables can be <em>positive</em>
          <idx><h>positive association</h></idx>
      or <em>negative</em>,
          <idx><h>negative association</h></idx>
      or there can be no association.
      Positive association means that larger values of the first variable are associated with larger values of the second variable.
      Additionally,
      the association can follow a linear trend or a curved (nonlinear) trend.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What would it mean for two variables to have a
          <em>negative</em> association?
          What about <em>no</em> association?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Negative association implies that larger values of the first variable are associated with smaller values of the second variable.
          No association implies that the values of the second variable tend to be independent of changes in the first variable.
        </p>

      <statement>

          What can be said about the relationship between these variables?

      <solution>
        <p>
          The relationship is evidently <term>nonlinear</term>,
          as highlighted by the dashed line.
          This is different from previous scatterplots we've seen,
          which show relationships that do not show much,
          if any, curvature in the trend.
          There is also a negative association,
          as higher rates of poverty tend to be associated with lower median household income.

      Sometimes two variables is one too many:
      only one variable may be of interest.
      In these cases we want to focus not on the association between two variables,
      but on the distribution of a single,
      or <term>univariate</term>, variable.
      The term <term>distribution</term>
      refers to the values that a variable takes and the frequency of these values.
      Here we introduce a new data set,
      the <c>email50</c> data set.
      This data set contains the number of characters in 50 emails.
      To simplify the data,
      we will round the numbers and record the values in thousands.
      Thus, 22105 is recorded as 22.

      Rather than look at the data as a list of numbers,
      which makes the distribution difficult to discern,
      we will organize it into a table called a
      <term>stem-and-leaf plot</term>
      shown in <xref ref="stemandleafemail50"></xref>.
      In a stem-and-leaf plot, each number is broken into two parts.
      The first part is called the <term>stem</term>
      and consists of the beginning digit(s).
      The second part is called the <term>leaf</term>
      and consists of the final digit(s).
      The stems are written in a column in ascending order,
      and the leaves that match up with those stems are written on the corresponding row.
      <xref ref="stemandleafemail50"></xref>
      shows a stem-and-leaf plot of the number of characters in 50 emails.
      The stem represents the ten thousands place and the leaf represents the thousands place.
      For example, <c>1  |  2</c> corresponds to 12 thousand.
      When making a stem-and-leaf plot,
      remember to include a legend that describes what the stem and what the leaf represent.
      Without this,
      there is no way of knowing if <c>1 | 2</c> represents 1.2, 12, 120, 1200, etc.

      Another simple graph for univariate numerical data is a dot plot.
      A<nbsp/><term>dot plot</term> uses dots to show the <term>frequency</term>,
      or number of occurrences, of the values in a data set.
      The higher the stack of dots,
      the greater the number occurrences there are of the corresponding value.
      An example using the same data set,
      number of characters from 50 emails,

      These graphs make it easy to observe important features of the data,
      such as the location of clusters and presence of gaps.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Based on both the stem-and-leaf and dot plot,
          where are the values clustered and where are the gaps for the <c>email50</c> data set?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There is a large cluster in the 0 to less than 20 thousand range,
          with a peak around 1 thousand.
          There are gaps between 30 and 40 thousand and between the two values in the 40 thousands and the largest value of approximately 64 thousand.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Additionally,
      we can easily identify any observations that appear to be unusually distant from the rest of the data.
      Unusually distant observations are called <term>outliers</term>.
          <idx><h>outlier</h></idx>
      Later in this chapter we will provide numerical rules of thumb for identifying outliers.
      For now, it is sufficient to identify them by observing gaps in the graph.
      In this case,
      it would be reasonable to classify the emails with character counts of 42 thousand, 43 thousand,
      and 64 thousand as outliers since they are numerically distant from most of the data.

      <title>Outliers are extreme</title>
      <p>
        An <term>outlier</term> is an observation that appears extreme relative to the rest of the data.

      <title>Why it is important to look for outliers</title>

        Examination of data for possible outliers serves many useful purposes,

          The observation 64 thousand,

          Which graph would better illustrate the data:

    <p>
      Stem-and-leaf plots and dot plots are ideal for displaying data from small samples because they show the exact values of the observations and how frequently they occur.
      However, they are impractical for larger samples.
      For larger samples, rather than showing the frequency of every value,
      we prefer to think of the value as belonging to a <em>bin</em>.
      For example,
      in the <c>email50</c> data set,
      we create a table of counts for the number of cases with character counts between 0 and 5,000,
      then the number of cases between 5,000 and 10,000, and so on.
      Such a table,
      shown in <xref ref="binnedNumCharTable"></xref>,
      is called a <term>frequency table</term>.
      Bins usually include the observations that fall on their left (lower) boundary and exclude observations that fall on their right (upper) boundary.
      This is called <em>left inclusive</em>.
      For example, 5 (i.e. 5000) would be counted in the 5-10 bin,
      not in the 0-5 bin.
      These binned counts are plotted as bars in <xref ref="email50NumCharHist"></xref>
      into what is called a <term>histogram</term>
      or <term>frequency histogram</term>,
      which resembles the stacked dot plot shown in <xref ref="emailCharactersDotPlotStacked"></xref>.

      Histograms provide a view of the
      <term>data density</term>.
      Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common.
      For instance,
      there are many more emails between 0 and 10,000 characters than emails between 10,000 and 20,000 in the data set.
      The bars make it easy to see how the density of the data changes relative to the number of characters.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many emails had fewer than 10 thousand characters?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The height of the bars corresponds to frequency.
          There were 19 cases from 0 to less than 5 thousand and 12 cases from 5 thousand to less than 10 thousand,
          so there were <m>19+12=31</m> emails with fewer than 10 thousand characters.

          Based just on this histogram,
          we cannot know the exact answer to this question.
          We only know that 19 emails had between 0 and 5 thousand characters.
          If the number of emails is evenly distribution on this interval,
          then we can estimate that approximately <m>19/5 \approx 4</m> emails fell in the range between 0 and 1 thousand.

        <p>
          From the first example,
          we know that 31 emails had fewer than 10 thousand characters.
          Since there are 50 emails in total,
          there must be 19 emails that have 10 thousand or more characters.
          To find the percent, compute <m>19/50 = 0.38 = 38\%</m>.

        <p>
          By tracing the height of the 15-20 thousand bin over to the vertical axis,
          we can see that it has a height just under 40 on the cumulative frequency scale.
          Therefore, we estimate that <m>\approx 39</m> of the emails had fewer than 30 thousand characters.
          Note that, unlike with a regular frequency histogram,
          we do not add up the height of the bars in a cumulative frequency histogram because each bar already represents a cumulative sum.

      <solution>
        <p>
          To answer this question, we do a subtraction.
          <m>\approx 39</m> had fewer than 15-20 thousand emails and <m>\approx 37</m> had fewer than 10-15 thousand emails,

      <solution>
        <p>
          This time we are given a cumulative frequency,
          so we start at 25 on the vertical axis and trace it across to see which bin it hits.
          It hits the 5-10 thousand bin,
          so 25 of the emails had fewer than a value somewhere between 5 and 10 thousand characters.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Knowing that 25 of the emails had fewer than a value between 5 and 10 thousand characters is useful information,
      but it is even more useful if we know what percent of the total 25 represents.
      Knowing that there were 50 total emails tells us that
      <m>25 / 50 = 0.5 = 50\%</m> of the emails had fewer than a value between 5 and 10 thousand characters.
      When we want to know what fraction or percent of the data meet a certain criteria,

      <term>Relative frequency</term>
          <idx><h>relative frequency</h></idx>
      is a fancy term for percent or proportion.
      It tells us how large a number is relative to the total.

    <p>
      Just as we constructed a frequency table, frequency histogram,

    <statement>
      <p>
        Each year, the US Census Bureau surveys about 3.5 million households with The American Community Survey (ACS).
        Data collected from the ACS have been crucial in government and policy decisions,
        helping to determine the allocation of federal and state funds each year.
        Some of the questions asked on the survey are about their income, age
        (in years),
        and gender.
        The table below contains this information for a random sample of 20 respondents to the 2012 ACS.<fn>United States Census Bureau. Summary File.<url href="https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/data_via_ftp/">2012 American Community Survey.</url>U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey Office, 2013. Web.</fn>

    <statement>
      <p>
        A baseball team's success in a season is usually measured by their number of wins.
        In order to win,
        the team has to have scored more points (runs) than their opponent in any given game.
        As such, number of runs is often a good proxy for the success of the team.
        The table below shows number of runs, home runs,
        and batting averages for a random sample of 10 teams in the 2014 Major League Baseball season.<fn><url href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/stats/team/_/stat/batting/year/2014">ESPN: MLB Team Stats - 2014.</url></fn>
