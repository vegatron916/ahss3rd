  <title>Active learning</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A teacher wanting to increase the active learning component of her course is concerned about student reactions to changes she is planning to make. She conducts a survey in her class, asking students whether they believe more active learning in the classroom (hands on exercises) instead of traditional lecture will helps improve their hearning. She does this at the beginning and end of the semester and wants to evaluate whether students' opinions have changed over the semester. Can she used the methods we learned in this chapter for this analysis? Explain your reasoning.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        No. The samples at the beginning and at the end of the semester are not independent since the survey is conducted on the same students.

  <title>Website expermiment</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
      	The OpenIntro website occasionally experiments with design and link placement. We conducted one experiment testing three different placements of a download link for this textbook on the book's main page to see which location, if any, led to the most downloads. The number of site visitors included in the experiment was 701 and is captured in one of the response combinations in the following table:

              Each individual in the experiment had an equal chance of being in any of the three experiment groups. However, we see that there are slightly different totals for the groups. Is there any evidence that the groups were actually imbalanced? Make sure to clearly state hypotheses, check conditions, calculate the appropriate test statistic and the p-value, and make your conclusion in context of the data.

  <title>Acetaminophen and liver damage</title>

      <p>
      	It is believed that large doses of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in over the counter pain relievers like Tylenol) may cause damage to the liver. A researcher wants to conduct a study to estimate the proportion of acetaminophen users who have liver damage. For participating in this study, he will pay each subject $20 and provide a free medical consultation if the patient has liver damage.

  <title>Rock-paper-scissors</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game played by two or more people where players choose to sign either rock, paper, or scissors with their hands. For your statistics class project, you want to evaluate whether players choose between these three options randomly, or if certain options are favored above others. You ask two friends to play rock-paper-scissors and count the times each option is played. The following table summarizes the data:
      </p>
    	<tabular halign="center">
    		<row bottom="minor">
    			<cell>Rock</cell>

      <p>
    		Use these data to evaluate whether players choose between these three options randomly, or if certain options are favored above others. Make sure to clearly outline each step of your analysis, and interpret your results in context of the data and the research question.

      <p>
        Use a chi-squared goodness of fit test. <m>H_{0}:</m> Each option is equally likely. <m>H_{A}:</m> Some options are preferred over others. Total sample size: 99. Expected counts: <m>(1/3) * 99 = 33</m> for each option. These are all above 5, so conditions are satisifed. <m>df =3- 1 = 2</m> and <m>\chi^2 = \frac{(43-33)^2}{33} + \frac{(21-33)^2}{33}+ \frac{(35-33)^2}{33} =7.52 \rightarrow \text{p-value }= 0.023</m>. Since the p-value is less than 5%, we reject <m>H_{0}</m>. The data provide convincing evidence that some options are preferred over others.

  <title>Browsing on the mobile device</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
      	A survey of 2,254 American adults indicates that 17% of cell phone owners browse the internet exclusively on their phone rather than a computer or other device.<fn>Pew Internet, <url href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/Reports/2012/Cell-Internet-Use-2012.aspx">Cell Internet Use 2012</url>, data collected between March 15 - April 13, 2012.</fn>

          <li>
            <p>
              According to an online article, a report from a mobile research company indicates that 38 percent of Chinese mobile web users only access the internet through their cell phones.<fn>S. Chang. <q>The Chinese Love to Use Feature Phone to Access the Internet</q>. In: <em>M.I.C Gadget</em> (2012).</fn> Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if these data provide strong evidence that the proportion of Americans who only use their cell phones to access the internet is different than the Chinese proportion of 38%.

Independence (random sample) and the success-failure condition are satisfied. <m>Z = -20.5 \rightarrow \text{p-value } \approx 0</m>. Since the p-value is very small, we reject <m>H_{0}</m>. The data provide strong evidence that the proportion of Americans who only use their cell phones to access the internet is different than the Chinese proportion of 38%, and the data indicate that the proportion is lower in the US.

              If in fact 38% of Americans used their cell phones as a primary access point to the internet, the probability of obtaining a random sample of 2,254 Americans where 17% or less or 59% or more use their only their cell phones to access the internet would be approximately 0.

In their final report, they would also like to note whether that proportion varies across the three cities.

Scientists suspect different variants of this gene might indicate an elevated risk for a particular genetic disease, and one way to evaluate this is to see if the general population distribution is the same in patients with the disease. The scientists will sample 450 patients with the disease and identify which variant each patient has.

  <title>Coffee and Depression</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
      	Researchers conducted a study investigating the relationship between caffeinated coffee consumption and risk of depression in women. They collected data on 50,739 women free of depression symptoms at the start of the study in the year 1996, and these women were followed through 2006. The researchers used questionnaires to collect data on caffeinated coffee consumption, asked each individual about physician- diagnosed depression, and also asked about the use of antidepressants. The table below shows the distribution of incidences of depression by amount of caffeinated coffee consumption.<fn>M. Lucas et al. <url href="https://www.openintro.org/redirect.php?go=textbook-coffee_caffeine_depression_2011&amp;referrer=ahss2_pdf"><q>Coffee, caffeine, and risk of depression among women</q>.</url> In: <em>Archives of internal medicine</em> 171.17 (2011), p. 1571.</fn>
