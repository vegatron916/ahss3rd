  <title>Pet names</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The city of Seattle, WA has an open data portal that includes pets registered in the city. For each registered pet, we have information on the pet's name and species. The following visualization plots the proportion of dogs with a given name versus the proportion of cats with the same name. The 20 most common cat and dog names are displayed. The diagonal line on the plot is the <m>x = y</m> line; if a name appeared on this line, the name's popularity would be exactly the same for dogs and cats.

  <title>Chia seeds and weight loss</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Chia Pets -- those terra-cotta figurines that sprout fuzzy green hair -- made the chia plant a household name. But chia has gained an entirely new reputation as a diet supplement.  In one 2009 study, a team of researchers recruited 38 men and divided them randomly into two groups: treatment or control. They also recruited 38 women, and they randomly placed half of these participants into the treatment group and the other half into the control group. One group was given 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, and the other was given a placebo. The subjects volunteered to be a part of the study. After 12 weeks, the scientists found no significant difference between the groups in appetite or weight loss.<fn>D.C.

One of the questions asked is, <q>Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to spend time with your kids after school?</q> Of the parents who replied, 85% said <q>no</q>.

              It is unlikely that the women who were reached at the same address 3 years later are a random sample. These missing responders are probably renters (as opposed to homeowners) which means that they might be in a lower socio-economic status than the respondents.

        In a public health study on the effects of consumption of fruits and vegetables on psychological well-being in young adults, participants were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) diet-as-usual, (2) an ecological momentary intervention involving text message reminders to increase their fruits and vegetable consumption plus a voucher to purchase them, or (3) a fruit and vegetable intervention in which participants were given two additional daily servings of fresh fruits and vegetables to consume on top of their normal diet. Participants were asked to take a nightly survey on their smartphones. Participants were student volunteers at the University of Otago, New Zealand. At the end of the 14-day study, only participants in the third group showed improvements to their psychological well-being acrossthe 14-days relative to the other groups.<fn>Tamlin S Conner et al. <q>Let them eat fruit!

  <title>Screens, teens, and psychologial well-being</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In a study of three nationally representative large-scale data sets from Ireland, the United States, and the United Kingdom (<m>n = 17,247</m>), teenagers between the ages of 12 to 15 were asked to keep a diary of their screen time and answer questions about how they felt or acted. The answers to these questions were then used to compute a psychological well-being score. Additional data were collected and included in the analysis, such as each child's sex and age, and on the mother's education, ethnicity, psychological distress, and employment. The study concluded that there is little clear-cut evidence that screen time decreases adolescent well-being.<fn>Amy Orben and AK Baukney-Przybylski. <url href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619830329"><q>Screens, Teens and Psychological Well-Being: Evidence from three time-use diary studies</q>.</url> In: <em>Psychological Science</em> (2018).</fn>
