      The chance of landing on single number in the game of roulette is 1/38 and the pay is 35:1.
      The chance of landing on Red is 18/38 and the pay is 1:1.
      Which game has the higher expected value?
      The higher standard deviation of expected winnings?
      How do we interpret these quantities in this context?
      If you were to play each game 20 times,
      what would the <em>distribution</em>
      of possible outcomes look like?
      In this section,
      we define and summarize random variables such as this,
      and we look at some of their properties.

    <title>Introduction to expected value</title>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Two books are assigned for a statistics class:
          a textbook and its corresponding study guide.
          The university bookstore determined 20% of enrolled students do not buy either book, 55% buy the textbook only,
          and 25% buy both books,
          and these percentages are relatively constant from one term to another.
          If there are 100 students enrolled,
          how many books should the bookstore expect to sell to this class?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution xml:id="bookStoreSales">
        <p>
          Around 20 students will not buy either book (0 books total),
          about 55 will buy one book (55 books total),
          and approximately 25 will buy two books
          (totaling 50 books for these 25 students).
          The bookstore should expect to sell about 105 books for this class.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Would you be surprised if the bookstore sold slightly more or less than 105 books?
          <fn>If they sell a little more or a little less, this should not be a surprise. Hopefully <xref ref="summarizingData"></xref> helped make clear that there is natural variability in observed data. For example, if we would flip a coin 100 times, it will not usually come up heads exactly half the time, but it will probably be close.</fn>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The textbook costs $137 and the study guide $33.
          How much revenue should the bookstore expect from this class of 100 students?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution xml:id="bookStoreRev">
        <p>
          About 55 students will just buy a textbook, providing revenue of
          <md>
            <mrow>\$137 \times  55 = \$7,535</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The roughly 25 students who buy both the textbook and the study guide would pay a total of
          <md>
            <mrow>(\$137 + \$33) \times  25 = \$170 \times  25 = \$4,250</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, the bookstore should expect to generate about
          <m>\$7,535 + \$4,250 = \$11,785</m> from these 100 students for this one class.
          However, there might be some <em>sampling variability</em>
          so the actual amount may differ by a little bit.

      <solution xml:id="revFromStudent">
        <p>
          The expected total revenue is $11,785, and there are 100 students.
          Therefore the expected revenue per student is <m>\$11,785/100 = \$117.85</m>.

      <title>Rules for probability distributions</title>
      <p>
        A probability distribution is a list of the possible outcomes with corresponding probabilities that satisfies three rules:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The outcomes listed must be disjoint.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Each probability must be between 0 and 1.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The probabilities must total 1.

          suggests three distributions for household income in the United States.
          Only one is correct.
          Which one must it be?
          What is wrong with the other two?
          <fn>The probabilities of (a) do not sum to 1.
          The second probability in (b) is negative.
          This leaves (c),
          which sure enough satisfies the requirements of a distribution.
          One of the three was said to be the actual distribution of US household incomes,
          so it must be (c).</fn>

      emphasized the importance of plotting data to provide quick summaries.
      Probability distributions can also be summarized in a histogram or bar plot.
      The probability distribution for the sum of two dice is shown in <xref ref="diceProb"></xref>
      and its histogram is plotted in <xref ref="diceSumDist"></xref>.
      The distribution of US household incomes is shown in <xref ref="usHouseholdIncomeDistBar"></xref> as a bar plot.
      The presence of the 100+ category makes it difficult to represent it with a regular histogram.
      <!-- <fn>
        It is also possible to construct a distribution plot when income is not artificially binned into four groups.
        Density histograms for <em>continuous</em>
        distributions are considered in <xref ref="contDist"></xref>.

    <p>
      In these bar plots,
      the bar heights represent the probabilities of outcomes.
      If the outcomes are numerical and discrete,
      it is usually (visually) convenient to make a histogram,
      as in the case of the sum of two dice.
      Another example of plotting the bars at their respective locations is shown in <xref ref="bookCostDist"></xref>.

      The expected value for a random variable represents the average outcome.
      For example,
      <m>E(X)=117.85</m> represents the average amount the bookstore expects to make from a single student,
      which we could also write as <m>\mu=117.85</m>.
      While the bookstore will make more than this on some students and less than this on other students,
      the average of many randomly selected students will be near $117.85.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also possible to compute the expected value of a continuous random variable.
      <!-- (see <xref ref="contDist"></xref>). -->
      However, it requires a little calculus and we save it for a later class.<fn>
      <m>\mu_{\scriptscriptstyle{X}} = \int xf(x)dx</m> where <m>f(x)</m> represents a function for the density curve.
      </fn>

    <p>
      In physics, the expectation holds the same meaning as the center of gravity.
      The distribution can be represented by a series of weights at each outcome,
      and the mean represents the balancing point.
      This is represented in <xref ref="bookCostDist"></xref>
      and <xref ref="bookWts"></xref>.
      The idea of a center of gravity also expands to continuous probability distributions.
      <xref ref="contBalance"></xref>
      shows a continuous probability distribution balanced atop a wedge placed at the mean.

    <title>Variability in random variables</title>
    <p>
      Suppose you ran the university bookstore.
      Besides how much revenue you expect to generate,
      you might also want to know the volatility (variability) in your revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The variance and standard deviation can be used to describe the variability of a random variable.
      <xref ref="variability"></xref>
      introduced a method for finding the variance and standard deviation for a data set.
      We first computed deviations from the mean (<m>x_i - \mu</m>),
      squared those deviations, and took an average to get the variance.
      In the case of a random variable,
      we again compute squared deviations.
      However, we take their sum weighted by their corresponding probabilities,
      just like we did for the expectation.
      This weighted sum of squared deviations equals the variance,
      and we calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance,
      just as we did in <xref ref="variability"></xref>.
    </p>

        then to find the standard deviation of <m>X</m>,
        we first find the variance and then take its square root.

      Just as it is possible to compute the mean of a continuous random variable using calculus,
      we can also use calculus to compute the variance.<fn>
      <m>\sigma^2_x = \int (x - \mu_{\scriptscriptstyle{X}})^2f(x)dx</m> where <m>f(x)</m> represents a function for the density curve.

      An online store is selling a limited edition t-shirt.
      The maximum a person is allowed to buy is 3.
      Let X be a random variable that represents how many of the t-shirts a t-shirt buyer orders.
      The probability distribution of X is given in the following table.

    <p>
      Using the methods of the previous section we can find that the mean
      <m>\mu_{X} = 1.5</m> and the standard deviation <m>\sigma_{X} = 0.67</m>.
      Suppose that the cost of each t-shirt is $30 and that there is flat rate $5 shipping fee.
      The amount of money a t-shirt buyer pays, then,
      is <m>30X + 5</m>, where X is the number of t-shirts ordered.
      To calculate the mean and standard deviation for the amount of money a t-shirt buyers pays,
      we could define a new variable <m>Y</m> as follows:
      <md>
        <mrow>Y = 30X + 5</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Using this new table,
      we can compute the mean and standard deviation of the cost for t-shirt orders.
      However, because Y is a linear transformation of X, we can use the properties from <xref ref="linearTransformationOfData"></xref>.
      Recall that multiplying every X by 30 multiplies both the mean and standard deviation by 30.
      Adding 5 only adds 5 to the mean,
      not the standard deviation.
      Therefore,
      <md>
        <mrow>\mu_{30X+5}\amp =E(30X+5) \amp  \sigma_{30X+5}\amp =SD(30X+5)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 30\times E(X) + 5 \amp  \amp = 30\times SD(X)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 30\times 1.5+5 \amp  \amp = 30 \times 0.67</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 50.00 \amp  \amp = 20.10</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Among t-shirt buyers, they spend an average of $50.00,
      with a standard deviation of $20.10.

    <title>Linear combinations of random variables</title>
    <p>
      So far, we have thought of each variable as being a complete story in and of itself.
      Sometimes it is more appropriate to use a combination of variables.
      For instance,
      the amount of time a person spends commuting to work each week can be broken down into several daily commutes.
      Similarly, the total gain or loss in a stock portfolio is the sum of the gains and losses in its components.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          John travels to work five days a week.
          We will use <m>X_1</m> to represent his travel time on Monday,
          <m>X_2</m> to represent his travel time on Tuesday, and so on.
          Write an equation using <m>X_1</m>, ..., <m>X_5</m> that represents his travel time for the week,
          denoted by <m>W</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          His total weekly travel time is the sum of the five daily values:
          <me>
            W = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Breaking the weekly travel time <m>W</m> into pieces provides a framework for understanding each source of randomness and is useful for modeling <m>W</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          It takes John an average of 18 minutes each day to commute to work.
          What would you expect his average commute time to be for the week?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We were told that the average (i.e. expected value) of the commute time is 18 minutes per day:
          <m>E(X_i) = 18</m>.
          To get the expected time for the sum of the five days,
          we can add up the expected time for each individual day:
          <md>
            <mrow>E(W) \amp = E(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = E(X_1) + E(X_2) + E(X_3) + E(X_4) + E(X_5)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 = 90\text{ minutes }</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The expectation of the total time is equal to the sum of the expected individual times.
          More generally,
          the expectation of a sum of random variables is always the sum of the expectation for each random variable.

      Two important concepts concerning combinations of random variables have so far been introduced.
      First, a final value can sometimes be described as the sum of its parts in an equation.
      Second, intuition suggests that putting the individual average values into this equation gives the average value we would expect in total.
      This second point needs clarification <mdash/> it is guaranteed to be true in what are called
      <em>linear combinations of random variables</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <term>linear combination</term>
      of two random variables <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> is a fancy phrase to describe a combination
      <me>
        aX + bY
      </me>
      where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are some fixed and known numbers.
      For John's commute time,
      there were five random variables <mdash/> one for each work day <mdash/> and each random variable could be written as having a fixed coefficient of 1:
      <me>
        1X_1 + 1 X_2 + 1 X_3 + 1 X_4 + 1 X_5
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For Elena's net gain or loss,
      the <m>X</m> random variable had a coefficient of +1 and the <m>Y</m> random variable had a coefficient of -1.
    </p>
    <p>
      When considering the average of a linear combination of random variables,
      it is safe to plug in the mean of each random variable and then compute the final result.
      For a few examples of nonlinear combinations of random variables <mdash/> cases where we cannot simply plug in the means <mdash/> see the footnote.<fn>
      If <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are random variables,
      consider the following combinations:
      <m>X^{1+Y}</m>, <m>X\times Y</m>, <m>X/Y</m>.
      In such cases,
      plugging in the average value for each random variable and computing the result will not generally lead to an accurate average value for the end result.
      </fn>
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Linear combinations of random variables and the average result</title>
      <p>
        If <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are random variables,
        then a linear combination of the random variables is given by <m>aX + bY</m>,
        where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are some fixed numbers.
        To compute the average value of a linear combination of random variables,
        plug in the average of each individual random variable and compute the result:
        <md>
          <mrow>E(aX+bY) = a\times E(X) + b\times E(Y)</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Recall that the expected value is the same as the mean, i.e.
        <m>E(X) = \mu_{X}</m>.

          Leonard has invested $6000 in Google Inc.
          (stock ticker: GOOG)
          and $2000 in Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM).
          If <m>X</m> represents the change in Google's stock next month and <m>Y</m> represents the change in Exxon Mobil stock next month,
          write an equation that describes how much money will be made or lost in Leonard's stocks for the month.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          For simplicity,
          we will suppose <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are not in percents but are in decimal form (e.g. if Google's stock increases 1%, then <m>X=0.01</m>;
          or if it loses 1%, then <m>X=-0.01</m>).
          Then we can write an equation for Leonard's gain as

            <mrow>\$6000\times X + \$2000\times Y</mrow>
          </md>

        <p>
          If we plug in the change in the stock value for <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>,
          this equation gives the change in value of Leonard's stock portfolio for the month.
          A positive value represents a gain,
          and a negative value represents a loss.

    <title>Variability in linear combinations of random variables</title>
    <p>
      Quantifying the average outcome from a linear combination of random variables is helpful,
      but it is also important to have some sense of the uncertainty associated with the total outcome of that combination of random variables.
      The expected net gain or loss of Leonard's stock portfolio was considered in <xref ref="expectedChangeInLeonardsStockPortfolio"></xref>.
      However, there was no quantitative discussion of the volatility of this portfolio.
      For instance,
      while the average monthly gain might be about $134 according to the data,
      that gain is not guaranteed.
      <xref ref="changeInLeonardsStockPortfolioFor36Months"></xref>
      shows the monthly changes in a portfolio like Leonard's during the 36 months from 2009 to 2011.
      The gains and losses vary widely,
      and quantifying these fluctuations is important when investing in stocks.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="changeInLeonardsStockPortfolioFor36Months">

    <p>
      Just as we have done in many previous cases,
      we use the variance and standard deviation to describe the uncertainty associated with Leonard's monthly returns.
      To do so, the standard deviations and variances of each stock's monthly return will be useful,
      and these are shown in <xref ref="sumStatOfGOOGXOM"></xref>.
      The stocks' returns are nearly independent.

    <p>
      We want to describe the uncertainty of Leonard's monthly returns by finding the standard deviation of the return on his combined portfolio.
      First, we note that the variance of a sum has a nice property:
      the variance of a sum is the sum of the variances.
      That<nbsp/>is, if X and Y are independent random variables:
      <md>
        <mrow>Var(X + Y) \amp = Var(X) + Var(Y)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the standard deviation is the square root of the variance,
      we can rewrite this equation using standard deviations:
      <md>
        <mrow>(SD_{X + Y})^2 = (SD_X)^2 + (SD_Y)^2</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This equation might remind you of a theorem from geometry:
      <m>c^2 = a^2 + b^2</m>.
      The equation for the standard deviation of the sum of two independent random variables looks analogous to the Pythagorean Theorem.
      Just as the Pythagorean Theorem only holds for right triangles,
      this equation only holds when X and Y are
      <em>independent</em>.<fn>
      Another word for independent is orthogonal, meaning right angle!
      When X and Y are dependent,
      the equation for <m>SD_{X+Y}</m> becomes analogous to the law of cosines.
      </fn>
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Standard deviation of the sum and difference of random variables</title>
      <p>
        If X and Y are <em>independent</em> random variables:
        <md>
          <mrow>SD_{X + Y} = SD_{X - Y} = \sqrt{(SD_X)^2 + (SD_Y)^2}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      Because <m>SD_Y</m> = <m>SD_{-Y}</m>,
      the standard deviation of the difference of two variables equals the standard deviation of the sum of two variables.
      This property holds for more than two variables as well.
      For example, if X, Y, and Z are independent random variables:
      <md>
        <mrow>SD_{X + Y + Z} = SD_{X - Y - Z}  = \sqrt{(SD_X)^2 + (SD_Y)^2 + (SD_Z)^2}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we need the standard deviation of a linear combination of independent variables,
      such as <m>aX + bY</m>,
      we can consider <m>aX</m> and <m>bY</m> as two new variables.
      Recall that multiplying all of the values of variable by a positive constant multiplies the standard deviation by that constant.
      Thus, <m>SD_{aX}</m> = <m>a \times SD_X</m> and <m>SD_{bY}</m> = <m>b \times SD_Y</m>.
      It follows that:
      <md>
        <mrow>SD_{aX + bY} = \sqrt{(a \times SD_X)^2 + (b \times SD_Y)^2}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This equation can be used to compute the standard deviation of Leonard's monthly return.
      Recall that Leonard has $6,000 in Google stock and $2,000 in Exxon Mobil's stock.
      From <xref ref="sumStatOfGOOGXOM"></xref>,
      the standard deviation of Google stock is 0.0849 and the standard deviation of Exxon Mobile stock is 0.0520.
      <md>
        <mrow>SD_{6000X + 2000Y} \amp = \sqrt{(6000\times SD_X)^2 + (2000\times SD_Y)^2}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \sqrt{(6000\times 0.0849)^2 + (2000\times .0520)^2}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \sqrt{270,304} = 520</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard deviation of the total is $520.
      While an average monthly return of $134 on an $8000 investment is nothing to scoff at,
      the monthly returns are so volatile that Leonard should not expect this income to be very stable.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Standard deviation of linear combinations of random variables</title>
      <p>
        To find the standard deviation of a linear combination of random variables,
        we first consider <m>aX</m> and <m>bY</m> separately.
        We find the standard deviation of each,
        and then we apply the equation for the standard deviation of the sum of two variables:
        <md>
          <mrow>SD_{aX + bY} = \sqrt{(a\times SD_X)^2 + (b\times SD_Y)^2}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        This equation is valid as long as the random variables <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are
        <em>independent</em> of each other.

          Three friends are playing a cooperative video game in which they have to complete a puzzle as fast as possible.
          Assume that the individual times of the 3 friends are independent of each other.
          The individual times of the friends in similar puzzles are approximately normally distributed with the following means and standard deviations.

          To advance to the next level of the game,
          the friends' total time must not exceed 17.1 minutes.
          What is the probability that they will advance to the next level?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Because each friend's time is approximately normally distributed,
          <em>the sum of their times is also approximately normally distributed</em>.
          We will do a normal approximation,
          but first we need to find the mean and standard deviation of the <em>sum</em>.
          We learned how to do this in <xref ref="randomVariablesSection"></xref>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let the three friends be labeled <m>X</m>, <m>Y</m>, <m>Z</m>.
          We want <m>P(X + Y + Z \lt  17.1)</m>.
          The mean and standard deviation of the sum of <m>X</m>,
          <m>Y</m>, and <m>Z</m> is given by:
          <md>
            <mrow>\mu_{sum} \amp = E(X+Y+Z) \amp  \sigma_{sum}\amp = \sqrt{(SD_X)^2+(SD_Y)^2 + (SD_Z)^2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = E(X) + E(Y) + E(Z) \amp  \amp = \sqrt{(0.11)^2+(0.13)^2+(0.12)^2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =4.6+4.8+4.5 \amp  \amp = 0.208</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =17.5</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can find the Z-score.
          <md>
            <mrow>Z \amp = \frac{x_{sum}-\mu_{sum}}{\sigma_{sum}}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\frac{17.1-17.5}{0.208}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =-1.92</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we want the probability that the sum is less than 17.5, so we shade the area to the left of <m>Z = -1.92</m>.
          Using the normal table or a calculator, we get
          <md>
            <mrow>P(Z \lt  -1.92) = 0.027</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a 2.7% chance that the friends will advance to the next level.

          What is the probability that Friend 2 will complete the puzzle with a faster time than Friend 1?
          Hint: find <m>P(Y \lt X)</m>, or <m>P(Y - X \lt 0)</m>.
          <fn>First find the mean and standard deviation of <m>Y-X</m>. The mean of <m>Y-X</m> is <m>\mu_{Y-X}= 5.8 - 5.6 = 0.2</m>. The standard deviation is <m>SD_{Y-X} = \sqrt{(0.13)^2+(0.11)^2} = 0.170</m>. Then <m>Z = \frac{0-0.2}{0.170}=-1.18</m> and <m>P(Z \lt -1.18)=0.119</m>. There is an 11.9% chance that Friend 2 will complete the puzzle with a faster time than Friend 1.</fn>

          A <term>discrete probability distribution</term>
          can be summarized in a table that consists of all possible outcomes of a random variable and the probabilities of those outcomes.
          The outcomes must be disjoint,
          and the sum of the probabilities must equal 1.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A probability distribution can be represented with a histogram and,
          like the distributions of data that we saw in <xref ref="summarizingData"></xref>, can be summarized by its <term>center</term>,

          When given a probability distribution table,
          we can calculate the <term>mean</term>
          (expected value)
          and <term>standard deviation</term>
          of a random variable using the following formulas.
          <md>
            <mrow>E(X) = \mu_{\scriptscriptstyle{X}} \amp = \sum{x_i\cdot P(x_i)} \amp</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = x_1\cdot P(x_1) + x_2\cdot P(x_2) + \cdots + x_n\cdot P(x_n)</mrow>
            <mrow>Var(X) = \sigma^2_x \amp = \sum(x_i - \mu_{\scriptscriptstyle{X}})^2 \cdot P(x_i)</mrow>
            <mrow>SD(X) = \sigma_{\scriptscriptstyle{X}} \amp =\sqrt{\sum(x_i - \mu_{\scriptscriptstyle{X}})^2 \cdot P(x_i)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\sqrt{(x_1-\mu_{\scriptscriptstyle{X}})^2\cdot P(x_1) + (x_2-\mu_{\scriptscriptstyle{X}})^2\cdot P(x_2) + \cdots +  (x_n-\mu_{\scriptscriptstyle{X}})^2\cdot P(x_n) }</mrow>
          </md>
          We can think of <m>P(x_i)</m> as the <em>weight</em>,
          and each term is weighted its appropriate amount.

        <p>
          The <term>mean</term> of a probability distribution does not need to be a value in the distribution.
          It represents the average of many,
          many repetitions of a random process.
          The <term>standard deviation</term>
          represents the typical variation of the outcomes from the mean,
          when the random process is repeated over and over.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Linear transformations</term>.
          Adding a constant to every value in a probability distribution adds that value to the mean,
          but it does not affect the standard deviation.
          When multiplying every value by a constant,
          this multiplies the mean by the constant and it multiplies the standard deviation by the absolute value of the constant.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Andy is always looking for ways to make money fast.
        Lately, he has been trying to make money by gambling.
        Here is the game he is considering playing: The game costs $2 to play.
        He draws a card from a deck.
        If he gets a number card (2-10), he wins nothing.
        For any face card ( jack, queen or king), he wins $3.
        For any ace, he wins $5, and he wins an <em>extra</em>
        $20 if he draws the ace of clubs.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Create a probability model and find Andy's expected profit per game.

        The game of American roulette involves spinning a wheel with 38 slots: 18 red, 18 black,
        and 2 green.
        A ball is spun onto the wheel and will eventually land in a slot,
        where each slot has an equal chance of capturing the ball.
        Gamblers can place bets on red or black.
        If the ball lands on their color, they double their money.
        If it lands on another color, they lose their money.

    <title>Lemonade at The Cafe</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Drink pitchers at The Cafe are intended to hold about 64 ounces of lemonade and glasses hold about 12 ounces.
        However, when the pitchers are filled by a server,
        they do not always fill it with exactly 64 ounces.
        There is some variability.
        Similarly, when they pour out some of the lemonade,
        they do not pour exactly 12 ounces.
        The amount of lemonade in a pitcher is normally distributed with mean 64 ounces and standard deviation 1.732 ounces.
        The amount of lemonade in a glass is normally distributed with mean 12 ounces and standard deviation 1 ounce.
