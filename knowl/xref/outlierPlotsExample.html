For each scatterplot and residual plot pair, identify any obvious outliers and note how they influence the least squares line.

<li><div class="para">There is one outlier on the right, though it is quite close to the least squares line, which suggests it wasn’t very influential.</div></li>

<li><div class="para">There is a primary cloud and then a small secondary cloud of four outliers. The secondary cloud appears to be influencing the line somewhat strongly, making the least squares line fit poorly almost everywhere. There might be an interesting explanation for the dual clouds, which is something that could be investigated.</div></li>
