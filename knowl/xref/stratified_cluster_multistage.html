In the top panel, stratified sampling was used: cases were grouped into strata, and then simple random sampling was employed within each stratum. In the middle panel, cluster sampling was used, where data were binned into nine cluster and three clusters were randomly selected. In the bottom panel, multistage sampling was used. Data were binned into the nine clusters, three of the cluster were randomly selected, and then six cases were randomly sampled in each of the three selected clusters.</figcaption></figure><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="section_obs_data_sampling.html#stratified_cluster_multistage">in-context</a></span>
