<div class="para">In Canada, about 0.35% of women over 40 will develop breast cancer in any given year. A common screening test for cancer is the mammogram, but this test is not perfect. In about 11% of patients with breast cancer, the test gives a <dfn class="terminology">false negative</dfn>: it indicates a woman does not have breast cancer when she does have breast cancer. Similarly, the test gives a <dfn class="terminology">false positive</dfn> in 7% of patients who do not have breast cancer: it indicates these patients have breast cancer when they actually do not.If we tested a random woman over 40 for breast cancer using a mammogram and the test came back positive — that is, the test suggested the patient has cancer — what is the probability that the patient actually has breast cancer?</div>

<div class="para">We are given sufficient information to quickly compute the probability of testing positive if a woman has breast cancer (<span class="process-math">\(1.00 - 0.11 = 0.89\)</span>). However, we seek the inverted probability of cancer given a positive test result:</div>

<div class="para">Here, “has BC” is an abbreviation for the patient actually having breast cancer, and “mammogram<span class="process-math">\(^+\)</span>” means the mammogram screening was positive, which in this case means the test suggests the patient has breast cancer. (Watch out for the non-intuitive medical language: a <em class="emphasis">positive</em> test result suggests the possible presence of cancer in a mammogram screening.) We can use the conditional probability formula from the previous section: <span class="process-math">\(P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and }  B)}{P(B)}\text{.}\)</span> Our conditional probability can be found as follows:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
