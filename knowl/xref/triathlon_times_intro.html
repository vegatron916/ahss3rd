<div class="para">In triathlons, it is common for racers to be placed into age and gender groups. Friends Leo and Mary both completed the Hermosa Beach Triathlon, where Leo competed in the <em class="emphasis">Men, Ages 30 - 34</em> group while Mary competed in the <em class="emphasis">Women, Ages 25 - 29</em> group. Leo completed the race in 1:22:28 (4948 seconds), while Mary completed the race in 1:31:53 (5513 seconds). Obviously Leo finished faster, but they are curious about how they did within their respective groups. Can you help them? Here is some information on the performance of their groups:</div>
<ul class="disc" id="triathlon_times_intro-2-1-3">
<li><div class="para">The finishing times of the <em class="emphasis">Men, Ages 30 - 34</em> group has a mean of 4313 seconds with a standard deviation of 583 seconds.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The finishing times of the <em class="emphasis">Women, Ages 25 - 29</em> group has a mean of 5261 seconds with a standard deviation of 807 seconds.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The distributions of finishing times for both groups are approximately Normal.</div></li>
</ul>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Remember: a better performance corresponds to a faster finish.</div>
