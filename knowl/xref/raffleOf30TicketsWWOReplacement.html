<div class="para">Your department is holding a raffle. They sell 30 tickets and offer seven prizes. (a) They place the tickets in a hat and draw one for each prize. The tickets are sampled without replacement, i.e. the selected tickets are not placed back in the hat. What is the probability of winning a prize if you buy one ticket? (b) What if the tickets are sampled with replacement? <details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="raffleOf30TicketsWWOReplacement-1-1-1"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 3.2.13"><sup> 13 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="raffleOf30TicketsWWOReplacement-1-1-1">(a) First determine the probability of not winning. The tickets are sampled without replacement, which means the probability you do not win on the first draw is <span class="process-math">\(29/30\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(28/29\)</span> for the second, ..., and <span class="process-math">\(23/24\)</span> for the seventh. The probability you win no prize is the product of these separate probabilities: <span class="process-math">\(23/30\text{.}\)</span> That is, the probability of winning a prize is <span class="process-math">\(1 - 23/30 = 7/30 = 0.233\text{.}\)</span> (b) When the tickets are sampled with replacement, there are seven independent draws. Again we first find the probability of not winning a prize: <span class="process-math">\((29/30)^7 = 0.789\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the probability of winning (at least) one prize when drawing with replacement is <span class="process-math">\(0.211\text{.}\)</span>
