<div class="para">Let’s consider a limited set of climate data, examining temperature differences in 1948 vs 2018. We randomly sampled 197 locations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) historical data, where the data was available for both years of interest. We want to know: were there more days with temperatures exceeding 90<span class="quantity">°F</span> in 2018 or 1948?<details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="global_warming_v2_1-2-1-2"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 7.2.6"><sup> 6 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="global_warming_v2_1-2-1-2">NOAA, <a class="external" href="www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets" target="_blank">www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets</a>, April 24, 2019.</div></details> The difference in number of days exceeding 90<span class="quantity">°F</span> (number of days in 2018 - number of days in 1948) was calculated for each of the 197 locations. The average of these differences was 2.9 days with a standard deviation of 17.2 days. We are interested in determining whether these data provide strong evidence that there were more days in 2018 that exceeded 90<span class="quantity">°F</span> from NOAA’s weather stations.</div> <div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/images/inference_means/global_warming_v2_1_diffs.png" class="contained"></div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha" id="global_warming_v2_1-2-3-1">
