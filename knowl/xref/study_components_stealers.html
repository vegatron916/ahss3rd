<div class="para">In a study of the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior, 129 University of California undergraduates at Berkeley were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money, most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs. They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. After completing some unrelated tasks, participants reported the number of candies they had taken.<details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="study_components_stealers-2-1-1"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 1.2.12"><sup> 12 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="study_components_stealers-2-1-1">P.K.
