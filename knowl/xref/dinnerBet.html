<div class="para">Suppose a restaurant is running a promotion where prices of menu items are random following some underlying distribution. If you’re lucky, you can get a basket of fries for $3, or if you’re not so lucky you might end up having to pay $10 for the same menu item. The price of basket of fries is drawn from a normal distribution with mean $6 and standard deviation of $2. The price of a fountain drink is drawn from a normal distribution with mean $3 and standard deviation of $1. What is the probability that you pay more than $10 for a dinner consisting of a basket of fries and a fountain drink?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="randomVariablesSection.html#dinnerBet">in-context</a></span>
