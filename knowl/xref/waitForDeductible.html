<div class="para">Suppose we are working at the insurance company and need to find a case where the person did not exceed her (or his) deductible as a case study. If the probability a person will not exceed her deductible is 0.7 and we are drawing people at random, what are the chances that the first person will not have exceeded her deductible, i.e. be a success? The second person? The third? What about the probability that we pull <span class="process-math">\(x - 1\)</span> cases before we find the first success, i.e. the first success is the <span class="process-math">\(x^{th}\)</span> person? (If the first success is the fifth person, then we say <span class="process-math">\(x=5\text{.}\)</span>)</div>
