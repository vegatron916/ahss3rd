<div class="para">Researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15. Participants reported their age, sex, and whether they were an only child or not. The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet, and said they would only reward children who report white.<details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="study_components_cheaters-2-1-1"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 1.2.11"><sup> 11 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="study_components_cheaters-2-1-1">Alessandro Bucciol and Marco Piovesan. <a class="external" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1307694" target="_blank">“Luck or cheating?

<li><div class="para">Who are the subjects in this study, and how many are included?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The study’s findings can be summarized as follows: “Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions. In the no instruction group probability of cheating was found to be uniform across groups based on child’s characteristics. In the group that was explicitly told to not cheat, girls were less likely to cheat, and while rate of cheating didn’t vary by age for boys, it decreased with age for girls.” How many variables were recorded for each subject in the study in order to conclude these findings? State the variables and their types.</div></li>
