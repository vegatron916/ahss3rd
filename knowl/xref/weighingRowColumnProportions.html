<div class="para">Data scientists use statistics to filter spam from incoming email messages. By noting specific characteristics of an email, a data scientist may be able to classify some emails as spam or not spam with high accuracy. One such characteristic is whether the email contains no numbers, small numbers, or big numbers. Another characteristic is the email format, which indicates whether or not an email has any HTML content, such as bolded text. We’ll focus on email format and spam status using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">email</code> data set, and these variables are summarized in a contingency table in <a href="categoricalData.html#emailSpamHTMLTableTotals" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/emailSpamHTMLTableTotals.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Table 2.4.9: A contingency table for spam and format.">Table 2.4.9</a>. Which would be more helpful to someone hoping to classify email as spam or regular email for this table: row or column proportions?</div>

<div class="para">A data scientist would be interested in how the proportion of spam changes within each email format. This corresponds to column proportions: the proportion of spam in plain text emails and the proportion of spam in HTML emails.</div> <div class="para">If we generate the column proportions, we can see that a higher fraction of plain text emails are spam (<span class="process-math">\(209/1195 = 17.5\%\)</span>) than compared to HTML emails (<span class="process-math">\(158/2726 = 5.8\%\)</span>). This information on its own is insufficient to classify an email as spam or not spam, as over 80% of plain text emails are not spam. Yet, when we carefully combine this information with many other characteristics, we stand a reasonable chance of being able to classify some emails as spam or not spam with confidence.</div>
