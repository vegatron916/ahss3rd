<div class="para">A study conducted at the University of Denver investigated whether babies take longer to learn to crawl in cold months, when they are often bundled in clothes that restrict their movement, than in warmer months.<details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="crawling_babies_corr_units-2-1-1"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 7.1.9"><sup> 9 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="crawling_babies_corr_units-2-1-1">J.B.

We consider the average crawling age of babies in each group against the average temperature when the babies are six months old (that’s when babies often begin trying to crawl).
