<div class="para">According to a report on sleep deprivation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the proportion of California residents who reported insufficient rest or sleep during each of the preceding 30 days is 8.0%, while this proportion is 8.8% for Oregon residents. These data are based on simple random samples of 11,545 California and 4,691 Oregon residents. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of Californians and Oregonians who are sleep deprived and interpret it in context of the data.<details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="sleep_OR_CA_CI-2-1-1"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 6.2.8"><sup> 8 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="sleep_OR_CA_CI-2-1-1">CDC, <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5842a2.htm" target="_blank">Perceived Insuficient Rest or Sleep Among Adults | United States, 2008.</a>

<li><div class="para">The title of this newspaper article makes it sound like using prenatal vitamins can prevent autism, which is a causal statement. Since this is an observational study, we cannot make causal statements based on the findings of the study. A more accurate title would be “Mothers who use prenatal vitamins before pregnancy are found to have children with a lower rate of autism”.</div></li>
