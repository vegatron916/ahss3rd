<div class="para">A hospital administrator hoping to improve wait times decides to estimate the average emergency room waiting time at her hospital. She collects a simple random sample of 64 patients and determines the time (in minutes) between when they checked in to the ER until they were first seen by a doctor. A 95% confidence interval based on this sample is (128 minutes, 147 minutes), which is based on the normal model for the mean. Determine whether the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.</div>

<li><div class="para">We are 95% confident that the average waiting time of these 64 emergency room patients is between 128 and 147 minutes.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We are 95% confident that the average waiting time of all patients at this hospitalâ€™s emergency room is between 128 and 147 minutes.</div></li>

<li><div class="para">True.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">False. The confidence interval is not about a sample mean.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">False. To be more confident that we capture the parameter, we need a wider interval. Think about needing a bigger net to be more sure of catching a fish in a murky lake.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">True. Optional explanation: This is true since the normal model was used to model the sample mean. The margin of error is half the width of the interval, and the sample mean is the midpoint of the interval.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">False. In the calculation of the standard error, we divide the standard deviation by the square root of the sample size. To cut the SE (or margin of error) in half, we would need to sample <span class="process-math">\(2^2 = 4\)</span> times the number of people in the initial sample.</div></li>
