<div class="para">The National Center of Education Statistics conducted a survey of high school seniors, collecting test data on reading, writing, and several other subjects. Here we examine a simple random sample of 200 students from this survey. Side-by-side box plots of reading and writing scores as well as a histogram of the differences in scores are shown below.</div> <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;">
