<div class="para">Sophia who took the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scored 160 on the Verbal Reasoning section and 157 on the Quantitative Reasoning section. The mean score for Verbal Reasoning section for all test takers was 151 with a standard deviation of 7, and the mean score for the Quantitative Reasoning was 153 with a standard deviation of 7.67. Suppose that both distributions are nearly normal.</div>

<li><div class="para">We cannot compare the raw scores since they are on different scales. Comparing her percentile scores is more appropriate when comparing her performance to others.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Answer to part (b) would not change as Z-scores can be calculated for distributions that are not normal. However, we could not answer parts (c)-(e) since we cannot use the normal probability table to calculate probabilitiesand percentiles without a normal model.</div></li>
