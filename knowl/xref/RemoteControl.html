<div class="para">A remote control car company is considering a new manufacturer for wheel gears. The new manufacturer would be more expensive but their higher quality gears are more reliable, resulting in happier customers and fewer warranty claims. However, management must be convinced that the more expensive gears are worth the conversion before they approve the switch. The quality control engineer collects a sample of gears, examining 1000 gears from each company and finds that 879 gears pass inspection from the current supplier and 958 pass inspection from the prospective supplier. Using these data, construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportion from each supplier that would pass inspection. Use the five step framework described above to organize your work.</div>

We will estimate the difference using a 95% confidence level.</div> <div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Choose</em>: Because the parameter to be estimated is a difference of proportions, we will use a 2-proportion Z-interval.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Check</em>: The samples are independent, but not necessarily random, so to proceed we must assume the gears are all independent. For this sample we will suppose this assumption is reasonable, but the engineer would be more knowledgeable as to whether this assumption is appropriate. We also must verify the minimum sample size conditions:</div>

<em class="emphasis">Conclude</em>: We are 95% confident that the true difference (current <span class="process-math">\(-\)</span> prospective) in the proportion that would pass inspection is between -0.103 and -0.055, meaning that we are 95% confident that the prospective supplier would have between a 5.5% and 10.3% <em class="emphasis">greater</em> rate of passing inspection. Because the entire interval is below zero, the data provide sufficient evidence that the prospective gears pass inspection more often than the current gears. The remote control car company should go with the new manufacturer.</div>
