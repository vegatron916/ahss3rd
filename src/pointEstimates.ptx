  <title>Estimating unknown parameters</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Companies such as the Gallup and Pew Research frequently conduct polls as a way to understand the state of public opinion or knowledge on many topics,
      including politics,
      scientific understanding, brand recognition, and more.
      How well do these polls estimate the opinion or knowledge of the broader population?
      Why is a larger sample generally preferable to a smaller sample?
      And what role does the concept of a sampling distribution,
      introduced in the previous chapter,
      play in answering these questions?

    <title>Point estimates</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>point estimate</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      With this chapter,
      we move from the world of probability to the world of inference.
      Whereas <term>probability</term> involves using a known population value (parameter) to make a prediction about the likelihood of a particular sample value (statistic),
      <term>inference</term> involves using a calculated sample value (statistic) to estimate or better understand an unknown population value
      (parameter).
      For both of these,
      the concept of the sampling distribution is fundamental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose a poll suggested the US President's approval rating is 45%. We would consider 45% to be a
      <term>point estimate</term>
          <idx><h>estimate</h></idx>
      of the approval rating we might see if we collected responses from the entire population.
      This entire-population response proportion is generally referred to as the
      <term>parameter</term> of interest,
          <idx><h>parameter of interest</h></idx>
      and when the parameter is a proportion,
      we denote it with the letter <m>p</m>.
      We typically estimate the parameter by collecting information from a sample of the population;
      we compute the observed proportion in the sample and we denote this sample proportion as <m>\hat{p}</m>.
      Unless we collect responses from every individual in the sample,
      <m>p</m> remains unknown,
      and we use <m>\hat{p}</m> as our point estimate for<nbsp/><m>p</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference we observe from the poll versus the parameter is called the
      <term>error</term> in the estimate.
      Generally, the error consists of two aspects:
      sampling error and bias.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Bias</em>
          <idx><h>bias</h></idx>
      describes a systematic tendency to over- or under-estimate the true population value.
      For instance,
      if we took a political poll but our sample didn't include a roughly representative distribution of the political parties,
      the sample would likely skew in a particular direction and be biased.
      Taking a truly random sample helps avoid bias.
      However, as we saw in <xref ref="introductionToData"></xref>,
      even with a random sample,
      various types of response bias can still be present.
      For<nbsp/>example,
      if we were taking a student poll asking about support for a new college stadium,
      we'd probably get a biased estimate of the stadium's level of student support by wording the question as,
      <em>Do you support your school by supporting funding for the new stadium?</em>
      We try to minimize bias through thoughtful data collection procedures,
      but bias can creep into our estimates without us even <!-- be "typo" --> being aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Sampling error</em>
          <idx><h>sampling error</h></idx>
      is uncertainty in a point estimate that happens naturally from one sample to the next.
      Much of statistics, including much of this book,
      is focused on understanding and quantifying sampling error.
      Remember though,
      that sampling error does not account for the possible effects of leading questions or other types of response bias.
      When we measure sampling error,
      we are measuring the expected variability in a point estimate that arises from randomly sampling only a subset of the population.

    <title>Understanding the variability of a point estimate</title>
    <p>
      Suppose the proportion of American adults who support the expansion of solar energy is <m>p = 0.88</m>,
      which is our parameter of interest.<fn>
      We haven't actually conducted a census to measure this value perfectly.
      However, a very large sample has suggested the actual level of support is about 88%.
      </fn> If we were to take a poll of 1000 American adults on this topic,
      the estimate would not be perfect,
      but how close might we expect the sample proportion in the poll would be to 88%? We want to understand,
      <em>how does the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> behave when the true population proportion is 0.88</em>.<fn>
      Note: 88% written as a proportion would be 0.88.
      It is common to switch between proportion and percent.
      </fn> Let's find out!
      We can simulate responses we would get from a simple random sample of 1000 American adults,
      which is only possible because we know the actual support expanding solar energy to be 0.88.
      Here's how we might go about constructing such a simulation:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            There were about 250 million American adults in 2018.
            On 250 million pieces of paper, write
            <q>support</q>
            on 88% of them and
            <q>not</q>
            on the other 12%.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Mix up the pieces of paper and pull out 1000 pieces to represent our sample of 1000 American adults.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Compute the fraction of the sample that say
            <q>support</q>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Any volunteers to conduct this simulation?
      Probably not.
      While this physical simulation is totally impractical,
      we can simulate it thousands,
      even millions, of times using computer code.
      We've written a short computer simulation and run it 10,000 times.
      The results are show in <xref ref="solarPollSimulationCodeR"></xref>
      in case you are curious what the computer code looks like.
      In this simulation,
      the sample gave a point estimate of <m>\hat{p}_1 = 0.894</m>.
      We<nbsp/>know the population proportion for the simulation was <m>p = 0.88</m>,
      so we know the estimate had an error of <m>0.894 - 0.88 = +0.014</m>.

    <p>
      One simulation isn't enough to get a great sense of the distribution of estimates we might expect in the simulation,
      so we should run more simulations.
      In a second simulation, we get <m>\hat{p}_2 = 0.885</m>,
      which has an error of<nbsp/>+0.005.
      In another, <m>\hat{p}_3 = 0.878</m> for an error of -0.002.
      And in another, an estimate of
      <m>\hat{p}_4 = 0.859</m> with an error of -0.021.
      With the help of a computer,
      we've run the simulation 10,000 times and created a histogram of the results from all 10,000 simulations in <xref ref="sampling_10k_prop_88p"></xref>.
      This distribution of sample proportions is called a
      <term>sampling distribution</term>.
      We can characterize this sampling distribution as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <alert>Center.</alert> The center of the distribution is <m>\mu_{\hat{p}} = 0.880</m>, which is the same as the parameter. Notice that the simulation mimicked a simple random sample of the population, which is a straightforward sampling strategy that helps avoid sampling bias. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <alert>Spread.</alert> The standard deviation of the distribution is <m>\sigma_{\hat{p}} = 0.010</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <alert>Shape.</alert> The distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, and it <em>resembles a normal distribution</em>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      These findings are encouraging!
      When the population proportion is
      <m>p = 0.88</m> and the sample size is <m>n = 1000</m>,
      the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> tends to give a pretty good estimate of the population proportion.
      We also have the interesting observation that the histogram resembles a normal distribution.

      <title>Sampling distributions are

      <p>
        In real-world applications,
        we never actually observe the sampling distribution,
        yet it is useful to always think of a point estimate as coming from such a hypothetical distribution. Understanding the sampling distribution will help us characterize and make sense of the point estimates that we do observe.

      a bigger sample tends to provide a more precise point estimate than a smaller sample.
      Remember though, that this is only true for
      <em>random</em> samples.
      Additionally,
      a<nbsp/>bigger sample cannot correct for response bias or other types of bias that may be present.

  <subsection>
    <title>Introducing the standard error</title>
    <p>
      Point estimates only approximate the population parameter.
      How can we quantify the expected variability in a point estimate <m>\hat{p}</m>?
      The discussion in <xref ref="distributionphat"></xref> tells us how.
      The variability in the distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> is given by its standard deviation.
      If we know the population proportion,
      we can calculate the standard deviation of the point estimate <m>\hat{p}</m>.
      In our simulation we knew <m>p</m> was 0.88.
      Thus we can calculate the standard deviation as
      <md>
        <mrow>SD_{\hat{p}}\amp =\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{(0.88)(1-0.88)}{1000}}= 0.01</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we now look at the sampling distribution,
      we see that the typical distance sample proportions are from the true value of 0.88 is about 0.01.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider a random sample of size 80 from a population.
          We find that 15% of the sample support a controversial new ballot measure.
          How far is our estimate likely to be from the true percent that support the measure?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We would like to calculate the standard deviation of <m>\hat{p}</m>,
          but we run into a serious problem:
          <m>p</m> is <em>unknown</em>.
          In fact, when doing inference,
          <m>p</m> must be unknown, otherwise it is illogical to try to estimate it.
          We cannot calculate the <m>SD</m>,
          but we can estimate it using,
          you might have guessed, the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      This estimate of the standard deviation is known as the
      <em>standard error</em>,
          <idx><h>standard error</h></idx>
      or <m>SE</m> for short.
      <md>
        <mrow>SE_{\hat{p}}\amp =\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate and interpret the <m>SE</m> of <m>\hat{p}</m> for the previous example.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <md>
            <mrow>SE_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} =\sqrt{\frac{0.15(1-0.15)}{80}}=0.04</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The typical or expected error in our estimate is 4%.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If we quadruple the sample size from 80 to 320,
          what will happen to the <m>SE</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <md>
            <mrow>SE_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} =\sqrt{\frac{0.15(1-0.15)}{320}}=0.02</mrow>
          </md>
          The larger the sample size, the smaller our standard error.
          This is consistent with intuition:
          the more data we have, the more reliable an estimate will tend to be.
          However, quadrupling the sample size does not reduce the error by a factor of 4.
          Because of the square root,
          the effect is to reduce the error by a factor <m>\sqrt{4}</m>, or 2.

    <title>Basic properties of point estimates</title>
    <p>
      We achieved three goals in this section.
      First, we determined that point estimates from a sample may be used to estimate population parameters.
      We also determined that these point estimates are not exact:
      they vary from one sample to another.
      Lastly, we quantified the uncertainty of the sample proportion using what we call the standard error.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that the standard error only measures sampling error.
      It does not account for bias that results from leading questions or other types of response bias.
    </p>
    <p>
      When our sampling method produces estimates in an unbiased way,
      the sampling distribution will be <em>centered</em>
      on the true value and we call the method <term>accurate</term>.
      When the sampling method produces estimates that have
      <em>low variability</em>,
      the sampling distribution will have a low standard error,
      and we call the method <term>precise</term>.

          which of the distributions were produced by methods that are biased?
          That are accurate?

          Distributions (b) and (d) are centered on the parameter
          (the true value),
          so those methods are accurate.
          The methods that produced distributions (a) and (c) are biased,
          because those distributions are not centered on the parameter.
          From most precise to least precise,
          we have (a), (b), (c), (d).

      <solution>
        <p>
          If the point estimate is precise,
          but highly biased, then we will consistently get a bad estimate.
          On the other hand,
          if the point estimate is unbiased but not at all precise,
          then by random chance, we may get an estimate far from the true value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, when taking a sample,
          we generally get only one chance.
          It is the properties of the sampling distribution that tell us how much confidence we can have in the estimate.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      The strategy of using a sample statistic to estimate a parameter is quite common,
      and it's a strategy that we can apply to other statistics besides a proportion.
      For instance,
      if we want to estimate the average salary for graduates from a particular college,
      we could survey a random sample of recent graduates;
      in that example,
      we'd be using a sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> to estimate the population mean<nbsp/><m>\mu</m> for all graduates.
      As another example,
      if we want to estimate the difference in product prices for two websites,
      we might take a random sample of products available on both sites,
      check the prices on each, and use then compute the average difference;
      this strategy certainly wouldn't give us a perfect measurement of the actual difference,
      but it would give us a point estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this chapter emphases a single proportion context,
      we'll encounter many different contexts throughout this book where these methods will be applied.
      The principles and general ideas are the same,
      even if the details change a little.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          In this section we laid the groundwork for our study of <term>inference</term>.
          Inference involves using known sample values to estimate or better understand unknown population values.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A sample statistic can serve as a
          <term>point estimate</term>
          for an unknown parameter.
          For example,
          the sample mean is a point estimate for an unknown population mean,
          and the sample proportion is a point estimate for an unknown population proportion.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It is helpful to imagine a point estimate as being drawn from a particular sampling distribution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>standard error</term> (<m>\textbf{SE}</m>) of a point estimate tells us the typical error or uncertainty associated with the point estimate.
          It is also an estimate of the spread of the sampling distribution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A point estimate is <term>unbiased</term>
          (accurate) if the sampling distribution (i.e., the distribution of all possible outcomes of the point estimate from repeated samples from the same population) is <em>centered</em>
          on the true population parameter.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A point estimate has <term>lower variability</term>
          (more precise)
          when the <em>standard deviation</em>
          of the sampling distribution is smaller. item In a random sample,
          increasing the sample size <m>n</m> will make the standard error smaller.
          This is consistent with the intuition that larger samples tend to be more reliable,
          all other things being equal.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In general, we want a point estimate to be unbiased and to have low variability.
          Remember: the terms unbiased (accurate) and low variability (precise) are properties of generic point estimates,
          which are variables that have a
          <em>sampling distribution</em>.
          These terms do not apply to individual values of a point estimate,
          which are <em>numbers</em>.

              Suppose the students decide to sample again,
              this time collecting 90 students per sample,
              and they again collect 1,000 samples.
              They build a new distribution of sample proportions.
              How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained 40 observations?
