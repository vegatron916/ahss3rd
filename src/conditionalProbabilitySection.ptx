    <title>Exploring probabilities with a contingency table</title>
    <p>
      The <c>photo_classify</c> data set represents a sample of 1822 photos from a photo sharing website.
      Data scientists have been working to improve a classifier for whether the photo is about fashion or not,
      and these 659 photos represent a test for their classifier.
      Each photo gets two classifications:
      the first is called <c>machLearn</c> and gives a classification from a machine learning (ML) system of either <c>pred_fashion</c> or <c>pred_not</c>.
      Each of these 1822 photos have also been classified carefully by a team of people,
      which we take to be the source of truth;
      this variable is called <c>truth</c> and takes values <c>fashion</c> and <c>not</c>.
      <xref ref="contTableOfFashionPhotos"></xref> summarizes the results.

          We can estimate this probability using the data.
          Of the 309 fashion photos,
          the ML algorithm correctly classified 197 of the photos:

    <title>Defining conditional probability</title>
    <p>
          <idx><h>conditional probability</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ML classifier predicts whether a photo is about fashion,
      even if it is not perfect.
      We would like to better understand how to use information from a variable like <c>mach_learn</c> to improve our probability estimation of a second variable,
      which in this example is <c>truth</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The probability that a random photo from the data set is about fashion is about 0.17.
      If we knew the machine learning classifier predicted the photo was about fashion,
      could we get a better estimate of the probability the photo is actually about fashion?
      Absolutely.
      To do so, we limit our view to only those 219 cases where the ML classifier predicted that the photo was about fashion and look at the fraction where the photo was actually about fashion:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{truth is fashion given machLearn is predFashion} ) = \frac{197}{219} = 0.900</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We call this a <term>conditional probability</term>
      because we computed the probability under a condition:
      the ML classifier prediction said the photo was about fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two parts to a conditional probability,
      the <term>outcome of interest</term>
      and the <term>condition</term>.
      It is useful to think of the condition as information we know to be true,
      and this information usually can be described as a known outcome or<nbsp/>event.
      We generally separate the text inside our probability notation into the outcome of interest and the condition with a vertical bar:
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp \amp  P(\text{truth is fashion given machLearn is predFashion} )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \amp   = P(\text{truth is fashion } | \text{ machLearn is predFashion}) = \frac{197}{219} = 0.900</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The vertical bar
      <q><m>|</m></q>
      is read as <em>given</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last equation,
      we computed the probability a photo was about fashion based on the condition that the ML algorithm predicted it was about fashion as a fraction:
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp  P(\text{truth is fashion } | \text{ machLearn is predFashion})</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \frac{\text{number cases where truth is fashion and machLearn is predFashion} } {\text{number cases where machLearn is predFashion} }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \frac{197}{219} = 0.900</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We considered only those cases that met the condition, <c>mach_learn</c> is <c>pred_fashion</c>,
      and then we computed the ratio of those cases that satisfied our outcome of interest,
      photo was actually about fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequently, marginal and joint probabilities are provided instead of count data.
      For example,
      disease rates are commonly listed in percentages rather than in a count format.
      We would like to be able to compute conditional probabilities even when no counts are available,
      and we use the last equation as a template to understand this technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      We considered only those cases that satisfied the condition,
      where the ML algorithm predicted fashion.
      Of these cases,
      the conditional probability was the fraction representing the outcome of interest,
      that the photo was about fashion.
      Suppose we were provided only the information in <xref ref="photoClassifyProbTable"></xref>,
      i.e. only probability data.
      Then if we took a sample of 1000 photos,
      we would anticipate about 12.0% or
      <m>0.120\times 1000 = 120</m> would be predicted to be about fashion (<c>mach_learn</c> is <c>pred_fashion</c>).
      Similarly, we would expect about 10.8% or
      <m>0.108\times 1000 = 108</m> to meet both the information criteria and represent our outcome of interest.
      Then the conditional probability can be computed as
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp P(\text{truth is fashion} | \text{machLearn is predFashion} )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{\text{number (truth is fashion and machLearn is predFashion)}} {\text{number( machLearn is predFashion)}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{108}{120} = \frac{0.108}{0.120} = 0.90</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we are examining exactly the fraction of two probabilities, 0.108 and 0.120, which we can write as
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{truth is fashion and machLearn is predFashion} ) \text{ and } P(\text{machLearn is predFashion} )</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fraction of these probabilities is an example of the general formula for conditional probability.

    <title>Smallpox in Boston, 1721</title>
    <p>
      The <c>smallpox</c> data set provides a sample of 6,224 individuals from the year 1721 who were exposed to smallpox in Boston.<fn>
      Fenner F. 1988.
      <em>Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6)</em>.
      Geneva: World Health Organization.
      ISBN 92-4-156110-6.
      </fn> Doctors at the time believed that inoculation,
      which involves exposing a person to the disease in a controlled form,
      could reduce the likelihood of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each case represents one person with two variables: <c>inoculated</c> and <c>result</c>.
      The variable <c>inoculated</c> takes two levels: <c>yes</c> or <c>no</c>,
      indicating whether the person was inoculated or not.
      The variable <c>result</c> has outcomes <c>lived</c> or <c>died</c>.
      These data are summarized in <xref ref="smallpoxContingencyTable"></xref>
      and <xref ref="smallpoxProbabilityTable"></xref>.

      introduced the Multiplication Rule for independent processes.
      Here we provide the <term>General Multiplication Rule</term>
      for events that might not be independent.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>General Multiplication Rule</title>
      <p>
        If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> represent two outcomes or events, then
        <md>
          <mrow>P(A\text{ and } B) = P(A | B)\times P(B)</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        For the term <m>P(A | B)</m>,
        it is useful to think of <m>A</m> as the outcome of interest and <m>B</m> as the condition.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      This General Multiplication Rule is simply a rearrangement of the definition for conditional probability.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the <c>smallpox</c> data set.
          Suppose we are given only two pieces of information: 96.08% of residents were not inoculated,
          and 85.88% of the residents who were not inoculated ended up surviving.
          How could we compute the probability that a resident was not inoculated and lived?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We will compute our answer using the General Multiplication Rule and then verify it using <xref ref="smallpoxProbabilityTable"></xref>.
          We want to determine
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{lived and not inoculated} )</mrow>
          </md>
          and we are given that
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{lived } | \text{ not inoculated} )=0.8588</mrow>
            <mrow>P(\text{not inoculated} )=0.9608</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the 96.08% of people who were not inoculated, 85.88% survived:
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{lived and not inoculated} ) = 0.8588\times 0.9608 = 0.8251</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is equivalent to the General Multiplication Rule.
          We can confirm this probability in <xref ref="smallpoxProbabilityTable"></xref>
          at the intersection of <c>no</c> and <c>lived</c> (with a small rounding error).

          If 97.54% of the inoculated people lived,
          what proportion of inoculated people must have died?
          <fn>There were only two possible outcomes: <c>lived</c> or <c>died</c>. This means that <m>100\% - 97.54\% = 2.46\%</m> of the people who were inoculated died.</fn>

        <p>
          Based on the probabilities computed above,
          does it appear that inoculation is effective at reducing the risk of death from smallpox?
          <fn>The samples are large relative to the difference in death rates for the <q>inoculated</q> and <q>not inoculated</q> groups, so it seems there is an association between inoculated and outcome. However, as noted in the solution to <xref ref="SmallpoxInoculationObsExpExercise"></xref>, this is an obervational study and we cannot be sure if there is a causal connection. (Further research has shown that inoculation is effective at reducing death rates.)</fn>

          Your department is holding a raffle.

          What is the probability of winning a prize if you buy one ticket? (b) What if the tickets are sampled with replacement?
          <fn>(a) First determine the probability of not winning.
          The tickets are sampled without replacement,

          <m>28/29</m> for the second, ..., and <m>23/24</m> for the seventh.
          The probability you win no prize is the product of these separate probabilities:

          That is, the probability of winning a prize is <m>1 - 23/30 = 7/30 = 0.233</m>. (b) When the tickets are sampled with replacement,

    <title>Checking for independent and mutually exclusive events</title>
    <p>
      If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent events,
      then the probability of <m>A</m> being true is unchanged if <m>B</m> is true.
      Mathematically, this is written as
      <md>
        <mrow>P(A|B) \amp = P(A)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The General Multiplication Rule states that
      <m>P(A\text{ and } B)</m> equals <m>P(A | B) \times P(B)</m>.
      If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent events,
      we can replace <m>P(A|B)</m> with <m>P(A)</m> and the following multiplication rule applies:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(A\text{ and } B) \amp = P(A)\times P(B)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

      <title>Checking whether two events are independent</title>
      <p>
        When checking whether two events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent,
        verify one of the following equations holds (there is no need to check both equations):
        <md>
          <mrow>P(A|B) \amp = P(A) \amp P(A\text{ and } B) \amp = P(A) \times P(B)</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the equation that is checked holds true
        (the left and right sides are equal),
        <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent.
        If the equation does not hold,
        then <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are dependent.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We'll use the first equation above to check for independence.
          If the <c>teen</c> and <c>parents</c> variables are independent,
          it must be true that

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Using <xref ref="contTableOfParStCollegeCopy"></xref>,
          we check whether equality holds in this equation.
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{teen college} | \text{parent degree} ) \amp \overset{?}{=} P(\text{teen college} )</mrow>

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The value 0.83 came from a probability calculation using <xref ref="contTableOfParStCollegeCopy"></xref>:
          <m>\frac{231}{280} \approx 0.83</m>.
          Because the sides are not equal,
          teenager college attendance and parent degree are dependent.
          That is, we estimate the probability a teenager attended college to be higher if we know that one of the teen's parents has a college degree.

        If asked to determine if events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are mutually exclusive,
        verify one of the following equations holds (there is no need to check both equations):

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Looking in the table,
          we see that there are 231 instances where both the teenager attended college and parents have a degree,
          indicating the probability of both events occurring is greater than 0.
          Since we have found an example where both of these events happen together,
          these two events are not mutually exclusive.
          We could more formally show this by computing the probability both events occur at the same time:
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{teen college, parent degree} ) = \frac{231}{792}\neq 0</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this probability is not zero,
          teenager college attendance and parent college degrees are not mutually exclusive.

    <assemblage>
      <title>Mutually exclusive and independent are different</title>
      <p>
        If two events are mutually exclusive,
        then if one is true, the other cannot be true.
        This implies the two events are in some way connected,
        meaning they must be dependent.
      </p>
      <p>
        If two events are independent, then if one occurs,
        it is still possible for the other to occur,
        meaning the events are not mutually exclusive.

      <title>Dependent events need not be mutually exclusive.</title>
      <p>
        If two events are dependent,
        we can <em>not</em> simply conclude they are mutually exclusive.
        For example,
        the college attendance of teenagers and a college degree by one of their parents are dependent,
        but those events are not mutually exclusive.

    <title>Tree diagrams</title>
    <p>
      <em>Tree diagrams</em> are a tool to organize outcomes and probabilities around the structure of the data.
      They are most useful when two or more processes occur in a sequence and each process is conditioned on its predecessors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <c>smallpox</c> data fit this description.
      We see the population as split by <c>inoculation</c>: <c>yes</c> and <c>no</c>.
      Following this split, survival rates were observed for each group.
      This structure is reflected in the tree diagram shown in <xref ref="smallpoxTreeDiagram"></xref>.
      The first branch for <c>inoculation</c> is said to be the <term>primary</term>
      branch while the other branches are <term>secondary</term>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="smallpoxTreeDiagram">
      <caption>A tree diagram of the <c>smallpox</c> data set.</caption>
      <image width="80%" source="images/probability/smallpoxTreeDiagram.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      Tree diagrams are annotated with marginal and conditional probabilities,
      as shown in <xref ref="smallpoxTreeDiagram"></xref>.
      This tree diagram splits the smallpox data by <c>inoculation</c> into the <c>yes</c> and <c>no</c> groups with respective marginal probabilities 0.0392 and 0.9608.
      The secondary branches are conditioned on the first,
      so we assign conditional probabilities to these branches.
      For example,
      the top branch in <xref ref="smallpoxTreeDiagram"></xref>
      is the probability that <c>lived</c> conditioned on the information that <c>inoculated</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may (and usually do) construct joint probabilities at the end of each branch in our tree by multiplying the numbers we come across as we move from left to right.
      These joint probabilities are computed using the General Multiplication Rule:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{inoculated and lived} ) \amp = P(\text{inoculated} )\times P(\text{lived } | \text{ inoculated} )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 0.0392\times 0.9754</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =0.0382</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What is the probability that a randomly selected person who was inoculated died?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This is equivalent to <m>P(\text{died } | \text{ inoculated} )</m>.
          This conditional probability can be found in the second branch as 0.0246.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There are two ways that a person could have lived:
          be inoculated <em>and</em> live OR not be inoculated <em>and</em> live.
          To find this probability, we sum the two disjoint probabilities:
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{lived} ) = 0.0392 \times 0.9745 + 0.9608 \times 0.8589 = 0.03824 + 0.82523 = 0.86347</mrow>

      This is more challenging because it cannot be read directly from the tree diagram.
      In these instances we use <term>Bayes' Theorem</term>.
      Let's begin by looking at a new example.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="probabilityOfBreastCancerGivenPositiveTestExample">
      <statement>
        <p>
          In Canada, about 0.35% of women over 40 will develop breast cancer in any given year.
          A common screening test for cancer is the mammogram,
          but this test is not perfect.
          In about 11% of patients with breast cancer,
          the test gives a <term>false negative</term>:
          it indicates a woman does not have breast cancer when she does have breast cancer.
          Similarly, the test gives a <term>false positive</term>
          in 7% of patients who do not have breast cancer:
          it indicates these patients have breast cancer when they actually do not.If we tested a random woman over 40 for breast cancer using a mammogram and the test came back positive <mdash/> that is,
          the test suggested the patient has cancer <mdash/> what is the probability that the patient actually has breast cancer?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We are given sufficient information to quickly compute the probability of testing positive if a woman has breast cancer
          (<m>1.00 - 0.11 = 0.89</m>).
          However, we seek the inverted probability of cancer given a positive test result:
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{ has BC } \ |\ \text{ mammogram\(^+\) } )</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here,
          <q>has BC</q>
          is an abbreviation for the patient actually having breast cancer, and
          <q>mammogram<m>^+</m></q>
          means the mammogram screening was positive,
          which in this case means the test suggests the patient has breast cancer.
          (Watch out for the non-intuitive medical language:
          a<nbsp/><em>positive</em> test result suggests the possible presence of cancer in a mammogram screening.)
          We can use the conditional probability formula from the previous section:
          <m>P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and }  B)}{P(B)}</m>.
          Our conditional probability can be found as follows:
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{ has BC \(|\) mammogram\(^+\) } ) \amp =  \frac{P(\text{ has BC and mammogram\(^+\) } )}{P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) } )}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The probability that a mammogram is positive is as follows.
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) } )=P(\text{ has BC and mammogram\(^+\) } ) +  P(\text{ no BC and mammogram\(^+\) } )</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          A tree diagram is useful for identifying each probability and is shown in <xref ref="BreastCancerTreeDiagram"></xref>.
          Using the tree diagram, we find that
          <md>
            <mrow>P(\amp \text{ has BC \(|\) mammogram\(^+\) } )</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{P(\text{ has BC and mammogram\(^+\) } )}{P(\text{ has BC and mammogram\(^+\) } ) +  P(\text{ no BC and mammogram\(^+\) } )}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{0.0035(0.89)}{0.0035(0.89)+0.9965(0.07)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{0.00312}{0.07288}\approx 0.0428</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

          That is, even if a patient has a positive mammogram screening,
          there is still only a 4% chance that she has breast cancer.

      highlights why doctors often run more tests regardless of a first positive test result.
      When a medical condition is rare,
      a single positive test isn't generally definitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider again the last equation of <xref ref="probabilityOfBreastCancerGivenPositiveTestExample"></xref>.
      Using the tree diagram, we can see that the numerator
      (the top of the fraction)
      is equal to the following product:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{ has BC and mammogram\(^+\) } ) = P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) }  | \text{ has BC } )P(\text{ has BC } )</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The denominator <mdash/> the probability the screening was positive <mdash/> is equal to the sum of probabilities for each positive screening scenario:
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{mammogram\(^+\)} ) \amp = P(\text{mammogram\(^+\) and no BC} ) + P(\text{mammogram\(^+\) and has BC} )</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the example,
      each of the probabilities on the right side was broken down into a product of a conditional probability and marginal probability using the tree diagram.
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) } ) \amp = P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) and no BC } ) + P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) and has BC } )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) }  | \text{ no BC } )P(\text{ no BC } )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \qquad\qquad + P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) }  | \text{ has BC } )P(\text{ has BC } )</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can see an application of Bayes' Theorem by substituting the resulting probability expressions into the numerator and denominator of the original conditional probability.
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp  P(\text{ has BC }  | \text{ mammogram\(^+\) } )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  \qquad= \frac{P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) }  | \text{ has BC } )P(\text{ has BC } )} {P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) }  | \text{ no BC } )P(\text{ no BC } ) + P(\text{ mammogram\(^+\) }  | \text{ has BC } )P(\text{ has BC } )}</mrow>

      <title>Bayes' Theorem: inverting probabilities</title>

        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Bayes' Theorem states that this conditional probability can be identified as the following fraction:
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{P(B | A_1) P(A_1)} {P(B | A_1) P(A_1) + P(B | A_2) P(A_2) + \cdots + P(B | A_k) P(A_k)}</mrow>

      Bayes' Theorem is just a generalization of what we have done using tree diagrams.
      The formula need not be memorized,
      since it can always be derived using a tree diagram:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The numerator identifies the probability of getting both <m>A_1</m> and <m>B</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The denominator is the overall probability of getting <m>B</m>.
            Traverse each branch of the tree diagram that ends with event <m>B</m>.
            Add up the required products.

    <example xml:id="exerciseForParkingLotOnCampusBeingFullAndWhetherOrNotThereIsASportingEvent">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Jose visits campus every Thursday evening.
          However, some days the parking garage is full,
          often due to college events.
          There are academic events on 35% of evenings,
          sporting events on 20% of evenings,
          and no events on 45% of evenings.
          When there is an academic event,
          the garage fills up about 25% of the time,
          and it fills up 70% of evenings with sporting events.
          On evenings when there are no events,
          it only fills up about 5% of the time.
          If Jose comes to campus and finds the garage full,
          what is the probability that there is a sporting event?
          Use a tree diagram to solve this problem.

    <p>
      The last several exercises offered a way to update our belief about whether there is a sporting event,
      academic event,
      or no event going on at the school based on the information that the parking lot was full.
      This strategy of <em>updating beliefs</em>
      using Bayes' Theorem is actually the foundation of an entire section of statistics called
      <term>Bayesian statistics</term>.
      While Bayesian statistics is very important and useful,
      we will not have time to cover it in this book.

        <p>
          A <term>conditional probability</term>
          can be written as <m>P(A | B)</m> and is read,
          <q>Probability of <m>A</m> given <m>B</m></q>. <m>P(A|B)</m> is the probability of <m>A</m>,
          given that <m>B</m> has occurred.
          In a conditional probability,
          we are given some information.
          In an <term>unconditional probability</term>,
          such as <m>P(A)</m>, we are not given any information.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Sometimes <m>P(A | B)</m> can be deduced.
          For example,
          when drawing without replacement from a deck of cards,
          <m>P(\text{ 2nd draw is an Ace } | \text{ 1st draw was an Ace } ) = \frac{3}{51}</m>.
          When this is not the case, as when working with a table or a Venn diagram,
          one must use the conditional probability rule <m>P(A | B) = \frac{P(A\text{ and } B)}{P(B)}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In the last section,
          we saw that two events are <term>independent</term>
          when the outcome of one has no effect on the outcome of the other.
          When <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent, <m>P(A | B) = P(A)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>dependent</term>,
          find the probability of <m>A</m> <em>and</em>
          <m>B</m> using the <term>General Multiplication Rule</term>:
          <m>P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A | B)\times P(B)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In the <em>special case</em> where <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>independent</term>,
          <m>P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A)\times P(B)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>mutually exclusive</term>,
          they must be <term>dependent</term>,
          since the occurrence of one of them changes the probability that the other occurs to 0.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When sampling <term>without replacement</term>,
          such as drawing cards from a deck,
          make sure to use <em>conditional probabilities</em>
            <idx><h>conditional probability</h></idx>
          when solving <em>and</em> problems.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Sometimes, the conditional probability <m>P(B|A)</m> may be known,
          but we are interested in the
          <q>inverted</q>
          probability <m>P(A|B)</m>.
          <term>Bayes' Theorem</term> helps us solve such conditional probabilities that cannot be easily answered.
          However, rather than memorize Bayes' Theorem,
          one can generally draw a tree diagram and apply the conditional probability rule <m>P(A | B)=\frac{P(A\text{ and } B)}{P(B)}</m>.
          <!-- The resulting answer often has the form <m>\frac{w\times x\text{ } +\text{ } y\times z}{w\times x}</m>,
          where <m>w, x, y, z</m> are numbers from a tree diagram. -->

        In a classroom with 24 students, 7 students are wearing jeans, 4 are wearing shorts, 8 are wearing skirts,
        and the rest are wearing leggings.
        If we randomly select 3 students without replacement,
        what is the probability that one of the selected students is wearing leggings and the other two are wearing jeans?
        Note that these are mutually exclusive clothing options.

    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>P(\text{leggings, jeans, jeans}) = \frac{5}{24} \times \frac{7}{23} \times \frac{6}{22} = 0.0173</m> However, the person with leggings could have come 2nd or 3rd, and these each have this same probability, so <m>3 \times 0.0173= 0.0519</m>.

        A genetic test is used to determine if people have a predisposition for <em>thrombosis</em>,
        which is the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel that obstructs the flow of blood through the circulatory system.
        It is believed that 3% of people actually have this predisposition.
        The genetic test is 99% accurate if a person actually has the predisposition,
        meaning that the probability of a positive test result when a person actually has the predisposition is 0.99.
        The test is 98% accurate if a person does not have the predisposition.
        What is the probability that a randomly selected person who tests positive for the predisposition by the test actually has the predisposition?

      <p>
        Lupus is a medical phenomenon where antibodies that are supposed to attack foreign cells to prevent infections instead see plasma proteins as foreign bodies,
        leading to a high risk of blood clotting.
        It is believed tha t 2% of the population suffer from this disease.
        The test is 98% accurate if a person actually has the disease.
        The test is 74% accurate if a person does not have the disease.
        There is a line from the Fox television show <em>House</em>
        that is often used after a patient tests positive for lupus: <q>It's never lupus.</q> Do you think there is truth to this statement?
        Use appropriate probabilities to support your answer.

        0.0714. Even when a patient tests positive for lupus, there is only a 7.14% chance that he actually has lupus. House may be right.

        They found that 53% of the respondents voted in favor of Scott Walker.
        Additionally,
