  <title>Nutrition at Starbucks, Part II</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <xref ref="starbucks_cals_carbos"></xref> introduced a data set on nutrition information on Starbucks food menu items. Based on the scatterplot and the residual plot provided, describe the relationship between the protein content and calories of these menu items, and determine if a simple linear model is appropriate to predict amount of protein from the number of calories.
      </p>
      <image width="50%" source="images/regression/starbucks_cals_protein.png"/>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        There is an upwards trend. However, the variability is higher for higher calorie counts, and it looks like there might be two clusters of observations above and below the line on the right, so we should be cautious about fitting a linear model to these data.

  <title>Rate my professor</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Many college courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor anonymously. However, the use of these student evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is often criticized because these measures may reflect the infuence of non-teaching related characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor. Researchers at University of Texas, Austin collected data on teaching evaluation score (higher score means better) and standardized beauty score (a score of 0 means average, negative score means below average, and a positive score means above average) for a sample of 463 professors.<fn>Daniel S Hamermesh and Amy Parker. <q>Beauty in the classroom: Instructors' pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity</q>. In: <em>Economics of Education Review</em> 24.4 (2005), pp. 369-376.</fn> The scatterplot below shows the relationship between these variables, and regression output is provided for predicting teaching evaluation score from beauty score.

  <title>Trees</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The scatterplots below show the relationship between height, diameter, and volume of timber in 31 felled black cherry trees. The diameter of the tree is measured 4.5 feet above the ground.<fn>Source: R Dataset, <url href="stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/trees.html"> stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/trees.html</url>.</fn>

            <p>
              Suppose you have height and diameter measurements for another black cherry tree. Which of these variables would be preferable to use to predict the volume of timber in this tree using a simple linear regression model? Explain your reasoning.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              There is a weak-to-moderate, positive, linear association between height and volume. There also appears to be some non-constant variance since the volume of trees is more variable for taller trees.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There is a very strong, positive association between diameter and volume. The relationship may include slight curvature.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since the relationship is stronger between volume and diameter, using diameter would be preferred. However, as mentioned in part (b), the relationship between volume and diameter may not be, and so we may benefit from a model that properly accounts for nonlinearity.
